              toxicity, and hypersensitivity reactions that are believed to
              result from the formation of reactive metabolites. Although
              formation of protein-reactive acylating metabolites by phase II
              metabolism has been well-studied and proposed to be the cause of
              these toxic side effects, the oxidative bioactivation of MFA has
              not yet been competely characterized. In the present study, the
              oxidative bioactivation of MFA was studied using human liver
              microsomes (HLM) and recombinant human P450 enzymes. In addition
              to the major metabolite 3'-OH-methyl-MFA, resulting from the
              benzylic hydroxylation by CYP2C9, 4'-hydroxy-MFA and
              5-hydroxy-MFA were identified as metabolites resulting from
              oxidative metabolism of both aromatic rings of MFA. In the
              presence of GSH, three GSH conjugates were formed that appeared
              to result from GSH conjugation of the two quinoneimines formed by
              further oxidation of 4'-hydroxy-MFA and 5-hydroxy-MFA. The major
              GSH conjugate was identified as 4'-OH-5'-glutathionyl-MFA and was
              formed at the highest activity by CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent
              by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Two minor GSH conjugates resulted from
              secondary oxidation of 5-hydroxy-MFA and were formed at the
              highest activity by CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4.
              Additionally, the ability of seven human glutathione
              S-transferases (hGSTs) to catalyze the GSH conjugation of the
              quinoneimines formed by P450s was also investigated. The highest
              increase of total GSH conjugation was observed with hGSTP1-1,
              followed by hepatic hGSTs hGSTA2-2 and hGSTM1-1. The results of

  abstract = "AIMS: Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2
              (SGLT2) inhibitor that decreases serum glucose by reducing renal
              glucose reabsorption, thereby promoting urinary glucose
              excretion. Dapagliflozin is primarily metabolized via the uridine
              diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A9 pathway to its major
              inactive metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide. The aim of
              this study was to evaluate the potential for drug-drug
              interaction between dapagliflozin and two potential UGT1A9
              modulators. METHODS: The results of two open-label,
              non-randomized, single-sequence studies are reported in which the
              effects of rifampin (a pleiotropic drug-metabolizing enzyme
              inducer; study 1) and mefenamic acid (a strong UGT1A9 inhibitor;
              study 2) were evaluated on the pharmacokinetics and
              pharmacodynamics (assessed by urinary glucose excretion [UGE]) of
              dapagliflozin in healthy subjects. In study 1, 14 subjects
              received single doses of dapagliflozin 10 mg alone and in the
              presence of rifampin 600 mg QD (6 days). In study 2, 16 subjects
              received single doses of dapagliflozin 10 mg alone and in the
              presence of mefenamic acid 250 mg q6h (5 days). RESULTS: Rifampin
              reduced total exposure (area under the concentration-time curve
              from time 0 to infinity [AUC0-inf]) to dapagliflozin by 22\% and
              mefenamic acid increased dapagliflozin AUC0-inf by 51\%. No
              clinically meaningful effect of rifampin or mefenamic acid on the
              pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin or on dapagliflozin-mediated
              urinary glucose excretion was observed. CONCLUSION: Modest
              changes in dapagliflozin exposure were seen with rifampin and

              $\beta$-estradiol-3-glucuronide (UGT1A1),

              of enzyme kinetic parameters at low human liver microsomal and

              a new recommended optimal universal alamethicin activation

              required for recombinant UGT incubations. Apparent enzyme kinetic
              parameters, particularly for UGT1A1 and UGT1A4, were affected by
              nonspecific binding. Unbound intrinsic clearance for UGT1A9 and
              UGT2B7 increased significantly after addition of 2\% bovine serum
              albumin, with minimal changes for UGT1A1, UGT1A4, and UGT1A6.

              1-aminobenzotriazole, minimally inhibited UGT activities and may
              be useful in reaction phenotyping of mixed UGT and cytochrome

              of the negative effects of aging. We show that factors found in
              young blood induce vascular remodeling, culminating in increased
              neurogenesis and improved olfactory discrimination in aging mice.
              Further, we show that GDF11 alone can improve the cerebral
              vasculature and enhance neurogenesis. The identification of
              factors that slow the age-dependent deterioration of the

              anthelmintic drugs used to combat these infections is widespread,
              including benzimidazole (BZ) compounds. Previous studies using
              the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to model
              parasitic nematode resistance have shown that loss-of-function
              mutations in the beta-tubulin gene ben-1 confer resistance to BZ
              drugs. However, the mechanism of resistance and the
              tissue-specific susceptibility are not well known in any nematode
              species. To identify in which tissue(s) ben-1 function underlies
              BZ susceptibility, transgenic strains that express ben-1 in
              different tissues, including hypodermis, muscles, neurons,
              intestine, and ubiquitous expression were generated.
              High-throughput fitness assays were performed to measure and
              compare the quantitative responses to BZ compounds among
              different transgenic lines. Significant BZ susceptibility was
              observed in animals expressing ben-1 in neurons, comparable to
              expression using the ben-1 promoter. This result suggests that
              ben-1 function in neurons underlies susceptibility to BZ.
              Subsetting neuronal expression of ben-1 based on the
              neurotransmitter system further restricted ben-1 function in
              cholinergic neurons to cause BZ susceptibility. These results

              resistance is now widespread in many species of parasitic
              nematodes in livestock globally and an emerging concern for the
              sustainable control of human soil-transmitted helminths.
              $\beta$-tubulin is the major benzimidazole target, although other
              genes may influence resistance. Among the 6 Caenorhabditis
              elegans $\beta$-tubulin genes, loss of ben-1 causes resistance
              without other apparent defects. Here, we explored the genetics of
              C. elegans $\beta$-tubulin genes in relation to the response to
              the benzimidazole derivative albendazole. The most highly
              expressed $\beta$-tubulin isotypes, encoded by tbb-1 and tbb-2,
              were known to be redundant with each other for viability, and
              their products are predicted not to bind benzimidazoles. We found
              that tbb-2 mutants, and to a lesser extent tbb-1 mutants, were
              hypersensitive to albendazole. The double mutant tbb-2 ben-1 is
              uncoordinated and short, resembling the wild type exposed to
              albendazole, but the tbb-1 ben-1 double mutant did not show the
              same phenotypes. These results suggest that tbb-2 is a modifier
              of albendazole sensitivity. To better understand how BEN-1
              mutates to cause benzimidazole resistance, we isolated mutants
              resistant to albendazole and found that 15 of 16 mutations
              occurred in the ben-1 coding region. Mutations ranged from likely
              nulls to hypomorphs, and several corresponded to residues that
              cause resistance in other organisms. Null alleles of ben-1 are
              albendazole-resistant and BEN-1 shows high sequence identity with
              tubulins from other organisms, suggesting that many amino acid
              changes could cause resistance. However, our results suggest that
              missense mutations conferring resistance are not evenly
              distributed across all possible conserved sites. Independent of
              their roles in benzimidazole resistance, tbb-1 and tbb-2 may have
              specialized functions as null mutants of tbb-1 or tbb-2 were cold
              or heat sensitive, respectively.",

               classes of 16-membered macrocyclic lactones (ML) that have a
               broad spectrum of activity. Most studies on the mode of action
               of ML have used the avermectin, ivermectin (IVM). IVM activates
               glutamate-gated chloride channels that contain alpha-type
               subunits, resulting in a hyperpolarization of the neuronal
               membrane, leading to a flaccid paralysis. IVM kills
               Caenorhabditis elegans at therapeutic concentrations, making it
               a useful model to examine mechanisms of IVM toxicity and
               resistance. There have been suggestions that the milbemycins may
               exert effects that are different from the avermectins, however
               this hypothesis has been challenged. Using IVM and the
               milbemycin, moxidectin (MOX), we demonstrate that while the two
               drugs have some similar effects on C. elegans, there are also
               some differences in worm response. Following exogenous exposure
               to a gradient of IVM and MOX, ranging from 0 to 5000 nM,
               quantitative and qualitative differences in response to the two
               anthelmintic drugs were observed in the pharyngeal pump rate,
               larval development and motility of wild-type and glutamate-gated
               chloride channel (GluCl) subunit knockout strains of C. elegans.
               After exposure to equimolar drug concentrations, differences

               phenotype in the wild-type, GluCl subunit knockout strains and
               multi-gene knockout strain of C. elegans that exhibits a marked
               reduction in IVM sensitivity; and transcription profiles of
               genes coding for GluCl subunits in both the wild-type and glc-2
               knockout strain. The glc-2 deletion strain showed increased
               motility in response to 2.5nM MOX in the first 1.5h of exposure,
               compared with wild-type nematodes, whereas this strain showed
               little change in motility in response to IVM. The pharyngeal
               pump rate in the glc-2 deletion strain was sensitive to
               equimolar concentrations of IVM and MOX. The triple
               avr-14/avr-15/glc-1 knockout caused a loss of initial
               stimulation of motility seen in the wild-type, by 2.5 nM IVM, to
               a reduction in motility, whereas the response to MOX was little

               substrates for the P-glycoproteins, which might explain their
               selective toxicity for parasites over their vertebrate hosts.
               Changes in the expression of these pumps have been implicated in
               resistance to the macrocyclic lactones, but it is clear that
               they exert their anthelmintic effects by binding to
               glutamate-gated chloride channels expressed on nematode neurones
               and pharyngeal muscle cells. This effect is quite distinct from
               the channel opening induced by glutamate, the endogenous
               transmitter acting at these receptors, which produces rapidly
               opening and desensitising channels. Ivermectin-activated
               channels open very slowly but essentially irreversibly, leading
               to a very long-lasting hyperpolarisation or depolarisation of
               the neurone or muscle cell and therefore blocking further
               function. Molecular and genetic studies have shown that there
               are multiple GluCl isoforms in both free-living and parasitic
               nematodes: the exact genetic make-up and functions of the GluCl
               may vary between species. The known expression patterns of the
               GluCl explain most of the observed biological effects of
               treatment with the macrocyclic lactones, though the reason for
               the long-lasting inhibition of larval production in filarial
               species is still poorly understood.",

               glutamate-(GluCl) and GABA-gated channels, are the targets of
               the macrocyclic lactone (ML) family of anthelmintics. Changes in
               the sequence and expression of these channels can cause
               resistance to the ML in laboratory models, such as
               Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in
               multiple GluCl subunit genes are required for high-level ML
               resistance in C. elegans, and this can be influenced by
               additional mutations in gap junction and amphid genes. Parasitic
               nematodes have a different complement of channel subunit genes
               from C. elegans, but a few genes, including avr-14, are widely
               present. A polymorphism in an avr-14 orthologue, which makes the
               subunit less sensitive to ivermectin and glutamate, has been
               identified in Cooperia oncophora, and polymorphisms in several
               subunits have been reported from resistant isolates of
               Haemonchus contortus. This has led to suggestions that ML
               resistance may be polygenic. Possible reasons for this, and its

               GluClalpha3B subunit from the parasite Haemonchus contortus were
               more sensitive to l-glutamate (EC(50) = 27.6 +/- 2.7 microM)
               than those formed by the homologous subunit from Caenorhabditis
               elegans (EC(50) = 2.2 +/- 0.12 mM). Ibotenate was a partial
               agonist (EC(50) = 87.7 +/- 3.5 microM). The H. contortus
               channels responded to low concentrations of ivermectin
               (estimated EC(50) = approximately 0.1 +/- 1.0 nM), opening
               slowly and irreversibly in a highly cooperative manner: the rate
               of channel opening was concentration-dependent. Responses to
               glutamate and ivermectin were inhibited by picrotoxinin and
               fipronil. Mutating an N-terminal domain amino acid, leucine 256,

               to 1.09 +/- 0.16. It increased the K(d) for radiolabeled
               ivermectin binding from 0.35 +/- 0.1 to 2.26 +/- 0.78 nM. Two

               detectable channel activity, but ivermectin binding was similar
               to wild-type. The substitution of any aromatic amino acid for
               Leu256 had similar effects in the radioligand binding assay.
               Molecular modeling studies suggested that the GluCl subunits
               have a fold similar to that of other Cys-loop ligand-gated ion

               insufficient to achieve adequate control, particularly against
               Strongyloides stercoralis. The impact of preventive chemotherapy
               (PC) against STH morbidity is still incompletely understood. The
               aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a
               community-based program with albendazole and ivermectin in a
               high transmission setting for S. stercoralis and hookworm.
               METHODOLOGY: Community-based pragmatic trial conducted in
               Tartagal, Argentina; from 2012 to 2015. Six communities (5070
               people) were enrolled for community-based PC with albendazole
               and ivermectin. Two communities (2721 people) were re-treated
               for second and third rounds. STH prevalence, anemia and
               malnutrition were explored through consecutive surveys.
               Anthropometric assessment of children, stool analysis, complete
               blood count and NIE-ELISA serology for S. stercoralis were
               performed. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: STH infection was associated with
               anemia and stunting in the baseline survey that included all
               communities and showed a STH prevalence of 47.6\% (almost
               exclusively hookworm and S. stercoralis). Among communities with
               multiple interventions, STH prevalence decreased from 62\% to
               23\% (p<0.001) after the first PC; anemia also diminished from
               52\% to 12\% (p<0.001). After two interventions S. stercoralis
               seroprevalence declined, from 51\% to 14\% (p<0.001) and
               stunting prevalence decreased, from 19\% to 12\% (p = 0.009).
               CONCLUSIONS: Hookworm' infections are associated with anemia in
               the general population and nutritional impairment in children.
               S. stercoralis is also associated with anemia. Community-based
               deworming with albendazole and ivermectin is effective for the
               reduction of STH prevalence and morbidity in communities with
               high prevalence of hookworm and S. stercoralis.",

              Nevertheless, there is limited efficacy of these drugs against

              trichuriasis. We describe a protocol for a trial investigating
              the efficacy and safety of the co-administration of ivermectin
              and albendazole against trichuriasis. METHODS: A double-blind,
              placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial will be conducted
              in three countries (C{\^o}te d'Ivoire, Tanzania and Lao PDR) with

              co-administered ivermectin and albendazole compared to standard
              albendazole monotherapy. We will enroll 600 participants aged
              6-60 years in each setting. The primary outcome is cure rate (CR)
              against Trichuris trichiura infection as assessed by Kato-Katz
              14-21 days after treatment. Secondary outcomes include CRs

              (Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis)
              and egg reduction rates (ERRs) against STH at 14-21 days, 180
              days and 360 days. Tolerability of treatment, infection status
              assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and potential
              benefits of deworming on nutritional and morbidity indicators

              and animals. Two complementary DNAs (GluClalpha and GluClbeta)
              encoding chloride channels that are gated by avermectin and
              glutamate, respectively, were isolated from Caenorhabditis
              elegans. To study the role of these subunits in conferring
              avermectin sensitivity we isolated a mutant C. elegans strain
              with a Tc1 transposable element insertion that functionally
              inactivated the GluClalpha gene (GluClalpha::Tc1).
              GluClalpha::Tc1 animals exhibit a normal phenotype including
              typical avermectin sensitivity. Xenopus oocytes expressing
              GluClalpha::Tc1 strain mRNA elicited reduced amplitude avermectin
              and glutamate-dependent chloride currents. Avermectin binding
              assays in GluClalpha::Tc1 strain membranes showed the presence of
              high affinity binding sites, with a reduced Bmax. These
              experiments suggest that GluClalpha is a target for avermectin
              and that additional glutamate-gated and avermectin-sensitive
              chloride channel subunits exist in C. elegans. We isolated a cDNA
              (GluClalpha2) encoding a chloride channel that shares 75\% amino
              acid identity with GluClalpha. This subunit forms homomeric
              channels that are gated irreversibly by avermectin and reversibly
              by glutamate. GluClalpha2 coassembles with GluClbeta to form
              heteromeric channels that are gated by both ligands. The presence
              of subunits related to GluClalpha may explain the low level and
              rarity of target site involvement in resistance to the avermectin
              class of compounds.",

               failed to activate the GLC-3 homo-oligomer at concentrations of

               determining the mode of action of hits. Visible whole-organism

              anthelmintic drugs used to combat these infections is widespread,
              including benzimidazole (BZ) compounds. Previous studies using
              the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to model
              parasitic nematode resistance have shown that loss-of-function
              mutations in the beta-tubulin gene ben-1 confer resistance to BZ
              drugs. However, the mechanism of resistance and the
              tissue-specific susceptibility are not well known in any nematode
              species. To identify in which tissue(s) ben-1 function underlies
              BZ susceptibility, transgenic strains that express ben-1 in
              different tissues, including hypodermis, muscles, neurons,
              intestine, and ubiquitous expression were generated.
              High-throughput fitness assays were performed to measure and
              compare the quantitative responses to BZ compounds among
              different transgenic lines. Significant BZ susceptibility was
              observed in animals expressing ben-1 in neurons, comparable to
              expression using the ben-1 promoter. This result suggests that
              ben-1 function in neurons underlies susceptibility to BZ.
              Subsetting neuronal expression of ben-1 based on the
              neurotransmitter system further restricted ben-1 function in
              cholinergic neurons to cause BZ susceptibility. These results
              better inform our current understanding of the cellular mode of

              strains to perform dose-response analyses across 26 anthelmintic
              drugs that represent the three major anthelmintic drug classes
              (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones, and nicotinic
              acetylcholine receptor agonists) in addition to seven other
              anthelmintic classes. First, we found that C. elegans strains
              displayed similar anthelmintic responses within drug classes and
              significant variation across drug classes. Next, we compared the
              effective concentration estimates to induce a 10\% maximal
              response (EC10) and slope estimates of each dose-response curve

              elegans is a useful model for screening potential nematicides
              before applications to helminths. Third, we quantified the levels
              of anthelmintic response variation caused by genetic differences
              among individuals (heritability) to each drug and observed a
              significant correlation between exposure closest to the EC10 and
              the exposure that exhibited the most heritable responses. These

              and a receptor concentration of 3.53 pmol/mg protein. [3H]IVM
              binding in C. elegans was linear with tissue protein
              concentration, and optimal binding occurred within a pH range of
              7.3 to 7.6. Kinetic analysis of the binding showed that the
              reaction proceeded by a two-step mechanism. Initially, a rapidly
              reversible complex was formed and, after additional incubation,
              this complex was transformed to a much more slowly reversible
              complex. Stereospecificity of [3H]IVM binding to C. elegans
              membranes was demonstrated by competition with a series of
              avermectin derivatives. The in vivo effects of IVM and its
              derivatives on C. elegans motility were concentration dependent
              and correlated well with their relative binding affinities.
              Several putative neurotransmitters including gamma-aminobutyric
              acid (GABA), carbamyl choline, taurine, glutamate and dopamine
              were tested and found to have no effect on IVM binding. Specific
              IVM binding sites were also identified in rat brain; however, the
              affinity was approximately 100-fold lower than that observed in
              C. elegans and stereospecificity studies demonstrated structural
              differences in the two binding sites. These results are the first
              direct demonstration of a specific IVM binding site in nematodes
              and thus are important in furthering our understanding of its
              mode of action.",

               Although many advances have been made in understanding the IVM
               resistance mechanism, its exact mechanism remains unclear for H.
               contortus. Therefore, understanding the resistance mechanism
               becomes increasingly important for controlling haemonchosis.
               Recent research showed that the metabolic state of bacteria
               influences their susceptibility to antibiotics. However, little
               information is available on the roles of metabolites and
               metabolic pathways in IVM resistance of H. contortus. In this
               study, comparative analyses of the metabolomics of
               IVM-susceptible and -resistant adult H. contortus worms were
               carried out to explore the role of H. contortus metabolism in
               IVM resistance. In total, 705 metabolites belonging to 42
               categories were detected, and 86 differential metabolites (17
               upregulated and 69 downregulated) were identified in the
               IVM-resistant strain compared to the susceptible one. A KEGG
               pathway analysis showed that these 86 differential metabolites
               were enriched in 42 pathways that mainly included purine
               metabolism; the biosynthesis of amino acids; glycine, serine,
               and threonine metabolism; and cysteine and methionine
               metabolism. These results showed that amino acid metabolism may
               be mediated by the uptake of IVM and related with IVM resistance
               in H. contortus. This study contributes to our understanding of
               the mechanisms of IVM resistance and may provide effective

               metabolomics in antimicrobial drug discovery and development is
               summarized and discussed. For this, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web

               has appeared less than 10years after the introduction of a new
               drug class. Field populations of this species now show
               resistance to all major anthelmintic drug classes, including

               In addition, resistance to the recently introduced
               amino-acetonitrile derivative class (monepantel) has already
               been reported. The existence of field populations showing

               This chapter reviews the history of the development of

               widely used anthelmintics in veterinary medicine. However, its
               efficacy is increasingly compromised by widespread resistance,

               most parasitic nematodes, including Haemonchus contortus, a
               blood-sucking parasitic nematode of small ruminants. METHODS: In
               this study, an H. contortus IVM-resistant strain from Zhaosu,
               Xinjiang, China, was isolated and assessed by the control test,
               faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and the larval
               development assay (LDA). Subsequently, comparative analyses on
               the transcriptomics of IVM-susceptible and IVM-resistant adult
               worms of this parasite were carried out using RNA sequencing
               (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics. RESULTS: In total, 543 (416 known,
               127 novel) and 359 (309 known, 50 novel) differentially
               expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in male and female adult
               worms of the resistant strain compared with those of the
               susceptible strain, respectively. In addition to several
               previously known candidate genes which were supposed to be
               associated with IVM resistance and whose functions were involved
               in receptor activity, transport, and detoxification, we found
               some new potential target genes, including those related to
               lipid metabolism, structural constituent of cuticle, and
               important pathways such as antigen processing and presentation,
               lysosome, autophagy, apoptosis, and NOD1-like receptor

               real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed that the

               female: 10 genes) were consistent with those obtained by the
               RNA-seq. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IVM has multiple
               effects, including both neuromuscular and non-neuromuscular
               targets, and provide valuable information for further studies on

  abstract = "An understanding of the relative contributions of different
              evolutionary forces on an organism's genome requires an accurate
              description of the patterns of genetic variation within and
              between natural populations. To this end, I report a survey of
              nucleotide polymorphism in six loci from 118 strains of the
              nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. These strains derive from wild
              populations of several regions within France, Germany, and new
              localities in Scotland, in addition to stock center isolates.
              Overall levels of silent-site diversity are low within and
              between populations of this self-fertile species, averaging 0.2\%
              in European samples and 0.3\% worldwide. Population structure is
              present despite a lack of association of sequences with
              geography, and migration appears to occur at all geographic
              scales. Linkage disequilibrium is extensive in the C. elegans
              genome, extending even between chromosomes. Nevertheless,
              recombination is clearly present in the pattern of polymorphisms,
              indicating that outcrossing is an infrequent, but important,
              feature in this species ancestry. The range of outcrossing rates
              consistent with the data is inferred from linkage disequilibrium,
              using ``scattered'' samples representing the collecting phase of
              the coalescent process in a subdivided population. I propose that
              genetic variation in this species is shaped largely by population
              subdivision due to self-fertilization coupled with long- and
              short-range migration between subpopulations.",

               the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, population density is
               monitored through specific glycosides of the dideoxysugar
               ascarylose (the 'ascarosides') that promote entry into an
               alternative larval stage, the non-feeding and highly persistent
               dauer stage. In addition, adult C. elegans males are attracted
               to hermaphrodites by a previously unidentified small-molecule
               signal. Here we show, by means of combinatorial activity-guided
               fractionation of the C. elegans metabolome, that the mating
               signal consists of a synergistic blend of three dauer-inducing
               ascarosides, which we call ascr\#2, ascr\#3 and ascr\#4. This
               blend of ascarosides acts as a potent male attractant at very
               low concentrations, whereas at the higher concentrations
               required for dauer formation the compounds no longer attract
               males and instead deter hermaphrodites. The ascarosides ascr\#2
               and ascr\#3 carry different, but overlapping, information, as
               ascr\#3 is more potent as a male attractant than ascr\#2,
               whereas ascr\#2 is slightly more potent than ascr\#3 in
               promoting dauer formation. We demonstrate that ascr\#2, ascr\#3
               and ascr\#4 are strongly synergistic, and that two types of
               neuron, the amphid single-ciliated sensory neuron type K (ASK)
               and the male-specific cephalic companion neuron (CEM), are
               required for male attraction by ascr\#3. On the basis of these
               results, male attraction and dauer formation in C. elegans
               appear as alternative behavioural responses to a common set of
               signalling molecules. The ascaroside signalling system thus
               connects reproductive and developmental pathways and represents
               a unique example of structure- and concentration-dependent
               differential activity of signalling molecules.",

               drug resistance in nematodes of domestic animals, and reduced
               drug cure rates in nematode infections of humans is alarming.
               Despite this looming health problem, there is a significant

               products'' (ESPs) and how they orchestrate a parasitic
               existence. In the current study, we have conducted the first
               metabolomic and lipidomic analysis of the infective third-stage
               filariform larvae (L3) of the predominant human hookworm Necator
               americanus using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
               Altogether, we have identified a total of 645 small molecules
               that were mainly produced through amino acid and
               glycerophospholipid metabolism. Putatively, 495 metabolites were
               unique to the somatic tissue extract, and 34 metabolites were
               present only in the ESP component. More than 21 novel mass
               features with nitrogen and sulfur functional groups were
               detected in the ESP component for the first time from helminths.
               While this study could not establish the biological functions of
               the metabolites identified, literature searches revealed that
               these metabolites possess various biological properties,

               imperative to diversify management options and to cope with the
               possible future emergence of resistance in parasitic nematodes.
               Here, a combined metabolomics and genomics approach was employed
               to investigate the chemical repertoire and biosynthetic
               potential of the bacterial endophyte Peribacillus
               frigoritolerans BE93, previously characterized to exhibit
               nematicidal activity against B. xylophilus. Feature-based
               molecular networking revealed the presence of diverse secondary
               metabolites. A cyclic imine heptapeptide, koranimine, was found
               to be among the most abundant secondary metabolites produced.

               biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), including a dedicated
               non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) BGC for koranimine. Given

               ivermectin-sensitive invertebrate $\alpha$ glutamate-gated
               chloride channel (GluCl). Results revealed the binding of
               koranimine at the allosteric site of the channel-the ivermectin

               when bound to the $\alpha$ GluCl receptor thus, suggesting a

              defects in feeding behavior and chemosensation. unc-119 has been
              physically mapped relative to a previously identified chromosomal
              break in linkage group III, and DNA clones covering the region
              can rescue the mutant phenotype in transgenic animals. Three more
              alleles at the locus, with identical phenotypes, have been
              induced and characterized, all of which are putative null
              alleles. The predicted UNC-119 protein has no significant
              similarity to other known proteins. Expression of an unc-119/lacZ
              fusion in transgenic animals is seen in many neurons, suggesting
              that the unc-119 mutant phenotype is due to a defect in the

              the injection or oral delivery of dsRNA, but an alternative
              approach, the expression of RNA hairpins from introduced DNA
              (hairpin RNAi; hpRNAi) has several advantages: (1) it can be
              induced systemically or in a tissue-specific manner; (2) because
              it is heritable, it allows consistent RNAi silencing across a

              be applied in refractory tissue such as neurons. hpRNAi has not

              efficient high-throughput production of hpRNAi constructs using

              cloning and characterization of the ges-1 gene from C. elegans,
              as well as the homologous gene form the nematode Caenorhabditis
              briggsae. The ges-1 esterases from the two nematodes are 83\%
              identical at the amino acid level and contain regions of
              significant similarity to insect and mammalian esterases; these
              conserved regions can be identified with residues believed to be
              necessary for esterase function. The ges-1 mRNAs from both C.
              elegans and C. briggsae are trans-spliced. The coding regions,
              the codon bias and the splicing signals of the two ges-1 genes
              are quite similar and most (6/7) of the intron position are
              retained precisely. Yet, the flanking sequences of the two ges-1
              genes appear to have diverged almost completely. For example, the
              C. elegans ges-1 5′-flanking region (as well as several introns)
              contains copies of three different SINE-like sequences,
              previously identified near the hsp-16 genes, near the unc-22 gene
              and in a repetitive element CeRep-3; none of these elements are
              found in the C. briggsae ges-1 gene. We show that: (1) the C.
              elegans ges-1 gene can be used to transform C. briggsae,
              whereupon expression of the exogenous ges-1 gene is confined to
              the C. briggsae intestine; (2) the ges-1 homologue cloned from C.
              briggsae can be transformed into C. elegans, whereupon it is
              expressed largely in the C. elegans intestine; and (3) a
              5′-deletion of the C. elegans ges-1 gene that we have previously
              shown to be expressed in the C. elegans pharynx is also expressed
              in the pharynx of C. briggsae (either in the presence or absence
              of vector sequences). These results suggest that the ges-1 gene
              control circuits have been maintained between the two nematode
              species, despite the divergent 5′-flanking sequences of the gene.
              This raises the question of the evolutionary distance between C.
              elegans and C. briggsae and we attempt to estimate the C.
              elegans-C. briggsae divergence time by analyzing the rate of
              synonymous substitutions in coding regions of ges-1 and six other
              C. elegans-C. briggsae gene pairs. We propose a new method of
              analysis, which attempts to remove rate differences found between
              different genes by extrapolating to zero codon bias. We estimate
              that the two nematode species have been separated for at least 40

              hypodermal cells occurs at the larval-to-adult molt, and is
              characterized in part by the formation of a morphologically
              distinct adult cuticle. The timing of this event is controlled by
              a pathway of heterochronic genes that includes the relatively
              direct regulatory gene, lin-29, and upstream genes lin-4, lin-14
              and lin-28. Using northern analysis to detect endogenous collagen
              mRNA levels and collagen/lacZ reporter constructs to monitor
              collagen transcriptional activity, we show that the
              stage-specific switch from larval cuticle to adult cuticle
              correlates with the transcriptional activation of adult-specific
              collagen genes and repression of larval-specific collagen genes.
              Heterochronic mutations that cause precocious formation of adult
              cuticle also cause precocious transcription of the adult-specific
              collagen genes, col-7 and col-19; heterochronic mutations that
              prevent the switch to adult cuticle cause continued expression of
              the larval collagen gene, col-17, in adults and prevent
              adult-specific activation of col-7 or col-19. A 235 bp segment of
              col-19 5' sequences is sufficient to direct the adult-specific
              expression of a col-19/lacZ reporter gene in hypodermal cells.
              These findings indicate that the heterochronic gene pathway
              regulates the timing of hypodermal cell terminal differentiation

               Although co-infection with multiple parasite species within a
               host is common, there is a dearth of tools with which to study
               the composition of these complex parasite communities. Helminth
               species vary in their pathogenicity, epidemiology and drug
               sensitivity and the interactions that occur between co-infecting
               species and their hosts are poorly understood. We describe the
               first application of deep amplicon sequencing to study parasitic
               nematode communities as well as introduce the concept of the
               gastro-intestinal ``nemabiome''. The approach is analogous to
               16S rDNA deep sequencing used to explore microbial communities,
               but utilizes the nematode ITS-2 rDNA locus instead.
               Gastro-intestinal parasites of cattle were used to develop the
               concept, as this host has many well-defined gastro-intestinal
               nematode species that commonly occur as complex co-infections.
               Further, the availability of pure mono-parasite populations from
               experimentally infected cattle allowed us to prepare mock
               parasite communities to determine, and correct for, species
               representation biases in the sequence data. We demonstrate that,
               once these biases have been corrected, accurate relative
               quantitation of gastro-intestinal parasitic nematode communities
               in cattle fecal samples can be achieved. We have validated the
               accuracy of the method applied to field-samples by comparing the
               results of detailed morphological examination of L3 larvae
               populations with those of the sequencing assay. The results
               illustrate the insights that can be gained into the species
               composition of parasite communities, using grazing cattle in the
               mid-west USA as an example. However, both the technical approach
               and the concept of the `nemabiome' have a wide range of
               potential applications in human and veterinary medicine. These
               include investigations of host-parasite and parasite-parasite
               interactions during co-infection, parasite epidemiology,

  abstract = "The recent registration in New Zealand of the first new class of
              broad-spectrum anthelmintic, for use against nematode parasites
              of ruminants, in nearly three decades has raised the possibility
              that parasite management practices could be improved to minimise
              the emergence of resistance to the new drug. A review of
              knowledge pertaining to the selection of anthelmintic resistance
              in nematode parasites of sheep highlights a number of management
              practices which could be altered to achieve this. A number of
              previously common practices such as whole-flock treatment of
              adult ewes around lambing, and treatment of lambs as they are
              moved onto pastures with low parasite contamination have been
              clearly identified as high risk for selecting resistant
              parasites. Once high-risk practices have been identified steps
              can be taken to either eliminate their use or mitigate the
              associated risk. Much of the focus on the management of
              resistance around the world is on the retention of susceptible
              genotypes in refugia. While approaches to retaining unselected
              parasites are likely to vary around the world, empirical studies
              indicate that the practice is likely to be effective at slowing
              the development of resistance. The challenge for farmers and
              advisors will be to strike a balance between retaining sufficient
              susceptible parasites to usefully delay the development of
              resistance while not unduly compromising animal performance and
              farm profitability. The merits of combining different classes of
              anthelmintic in order to slow the development of resistance
              remains somewhat contentious in some countries. However, the
              attributes of oral anthelmintics are such that they seem likely
              to meet most, if not all, of the criteria for combinations to be
              highly effective at slowing the build-up of resistance in
              nematode parasites. It is evident that considerable progress has
              been made in understanding the factors involved in selecting
              anthelmintic-resistant nematodes since the last broad-spectrum
              anthelmintic class was released in the early 1980s. Therefore, it
              should be possible to manage a new class of anthelmintic in such
              a way as to significantly extend its effective life. The
              challenge is likely to be in convincing farmers of the merits of
              adopting such pro-active strategies.",

               associated with ivermectin susceptibility (HG1A) and resistance
               (HG1E), respectively. Sequence analysis indicates that they
               differ in four amino acids. To explore the functional properties
               of the two alleles, a full-length cDNA encoding the beta
               subunit, a key functional component of the GABA receptor, was
               isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans (gab-1, corresponding to
               the GenBank locus ZC482.1) and coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes
               with the HG1 alleles. When gab-1 was coexpressed with either the

               However, when coapplied with 10 micro m GABA, ivermectin
               potentiated the GABA-evoked current of the GAB-1/HG1A receptor,

              have been suggested to contribute to drug resistance development.
              The present study was designed to compare the constitutive
              expression of individual CYPs and P-gps in females and males of
              H. contortus adults and to follow up on the changes in expression

              of ivermectin (IVM), which might occur during inaccurate
              treatment. The adults of inbred susceptible-Edinburgh strain
              (ISE, MHco3) of H. contortus were used for this purpose. The
              nematodes were incubated ex vivo with or without IVM (1, 10 and
              100 nM) in culture medium for 4, 12 and 24 h. After incubation,

              variability in the constitutive expression of individual CYPs and

              14-week period of drug release. Positive faecal egg counts (FEC)
              were recorded in each group during this period. Eggs recovered
              from faeces were used in an egg hatch assay (EHA) utilizing
              different concentrations of ABZ. O. circumcincta eggs from Groups
              2 and 3 had significantly higher LC50 values than Group 1; eggs
              of T. colubriformis from the ABZ-CRC treated Group 5 had a higher

              which dominated with high FEC. The remaining 6 animals showed
              little decline in LC50 or rise in FEC. The results demonstrate
              the ability of persistent drugs to screen for resistant parasites

              underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. Here, we show that
              endogenous and microbiota-dependent small molecule signals
              promote lipid desaturation via the nuclear receptor
              NHR-49/PPAR$\alpha$ in C. elegans. Untargeted metabolomics of a
              $\beta$-oxidation mutant, acdh-11, in which expression of the
              stearoyl-CoA desaturase FAT-7/SCD1 is constitutively increased,
              revealed accumulation of a $\beta$-cyclopropyl fatty acid,
              becyp\#1, that potently activates fat-7 expression via NHR-49.
              Biosynthesis of becyp\#1 is strictly dependent on expression of
              cyclopropane synthase by associated bacteria, e.g., E. coli.
              Screening for structurally related endogenous metabolites
              revealed a $\beta$-methyl fatty acid, bemeth\#1, whose activity
              mimics that of microbiota-dependent becyp\#1, but is derived from
              a methyltransferase, fcmt-1, that is conserved across Nematoda
              and likely originates from bacterial cyclopropane synthase via
              ancient horizontal gene transfer. Activation of fat-7 expression
              by these structurally similar metabolites is controlled by
              distinct mechanisms, as microbiota-dependent becyp\#1 is
              metabolized by a dedicated $\beta$-oxidation pathway, while the
              endogenous bemeth\#1 is metabolized via $\alpha$-oxidation.
              Collectively, we demonstrate that evolutionarily related
              biosynthetic pathways in metazoan host and associated microbiota

              screen via tedious and subjective visual inspection. Now,
              automated image analysis can effectively score many phenotypes.
              In practical application, customizing an image-analysis algorithm
              or finding a sufficient number of example cells to train a
              machine learning algorithm can be infeasible, particularly when

              approach that uses iterative feedback to readily score multiple
              subtle and complex morphological phenotypes in high-throughput,
              image-based screens. First, automated cytological profiling
              extracts hundreds of numerical descriptors for every cell in
              every image. Next, the researcher generates a rule (i.e.,
              classifier) to recognize cells with a phenotype of interest
              during a short, interactive training session using iterative
              feedback. Finally, all of the cells in the experiment are
              automatically classified and each sample is scored based on the
              presence of cells displaying the phenotype. By using this
              approach, we successfully scored images in RNA interference

              blot analysis of the C. elegans cosmid C35E8 identified a 4kbp
              EcoRI fragment which contained the 5' portion of the Glu-Cl beta

              subcloned and used as the template for polymerase chain reaction

              acid residues of Glu-Cl beta together with 1.4 kbp of 5' genomic

  title     = "Managing anthelmintic resistance--parasite fitness, drug use
               strategy and the potential for reversion towards susceptibility",
  author    = "Leathwick, Dave M",
  abstract  = "The rotation of different anthelmintic classes, on an
               approximately annual basis, has been widely promoted and adopted
               as a strategy to delay the development of anthelmintic
               resistance in nematode parasites. Part of the rationale for
               recommending this practice was the expectation that resistant
               genotype worms have a lower ecological fitness than susceptible
               worms, at least in the early stages of selection, and so
               reversion towards susceptibility could be expected in those
               years when an alternative class of anthelmintic was used. The
               routine use of combination anthelmintics might be expected to
               negate this opportunity for reversion because multiple classes
               of anthelmintic would be used simultaneously. A simulation model
               was used to investigate whether the optimal strategy for use of
               multiple drug classes (i.e. an annual rotation of two classes of
               anthelmintic or continuous use of two classes in combination)
               changed with the size of the fitness cost associated with
               resistance. Model simulations were run in which the fitness cost
               associated with each resistance gene was varied from 0\% to 15\%
               and the rate at which resistance developed was compared for each
               of the drug-use strategies. Other factors evaluated were the
               initial frequency of the resistance genes and the proportion of
               the population not exposed to treatment (i.e. in refugia).
               Increasing the proportion of the population in refugia always
               slowed the development of resistance, as did using combinations
               in preference to an annual rotation. As the fitness cost
               associated with resistance increased, resistance developed more
               slowly and this was more pronounced when a combination was used
               compared to a rotation. If the fitness cost was sufficiently
               high then resistance did not develop (i.e. the resistance gene
               frequency declined over time) and this occurred at lower fitness
               costs when a combination was used. The results, therefore,
               indicate that the optimal drug-use strategy to maximise the
               benefit of any fitness cost associated with resistance is the
               use of combinations of different anthelmintic classes. Manual
               calculations confirmed that, within the model, the only
               resistant genotypes capable of surviving treatment with a
               combination are those carrying multiple resistance genes. These
               individuals are less fit, resulting in the worm population
               surviving treatment having a lower overall ecological fitness.
               This is a previously unreported perspective on the use of
               combination anthelmintics and strengthens the argument that any
               new class of anthelmintic, for which resistance genes can be
               expected to be rare, should be brought to market in combination.",

  abstract = "Anthelmintic resistance is a major problem in livestock farming,
              especially of small ruminants, but our understanding of it has
              been limited by the difficulty in carrying out functional genetic
              studies on parasitic nematodes. An important nematode infecting
              sheep and goats is Haemonchus contortus; in many parts of the
              world this species is resistant to almost all the currently
              available drugs, including ivermectin. It is extremely
              polymorphic and to date it has proved impossible to relate any
              sequence polymorphisms to its ivermectin resistance status.
              Expression of candidate drug-resistance genes in Caenorhabditis
              elegans could provide a convenient means to study the effects of
              polymorphisms found in resistant parasites, but may be
              complicated by differences between the gene families of target
              and model organisms. We tested this using the glutamate-gated
              chloride channel (GluCl) gene family, which forms the ivermectin
              drug target and are candidate resistance genes. We expressed
              GluCl subunits from C. elegans and H. contortus in a highly
              resistant triple mutant C. elegans strain (DA1316) under the
              control of the avr-14 promoter; expression of GFP behind this
              promoter recapitulated the pattern previously reported for
              avr-14. Expression of ivermectin-sensitive subunits from both
              species restored drug sensitivity to transgenic worms, though
              some quantitative differences were noted between lines.
              Expression of an ivermectin-insensitive subunit, Hco-GLC-2, had
              no effect on drug sensitivity. Expression of a previously
              uncharacterised parasite-specific subunit, Hco-GLC-6, caused the
              transgenic worms to become ivermectin sensitive, suggesting that
              this subunit also encodes a GluCl that responds to the drug.
              These results demonstrate that both orthologous and paralogous
              subunits from C. elegans and H. contortus are able to rescue the
              ivermectin sensitivity of mutant C. elegans, though some
              quantitative differences were observed between transgenic lines
              in some assays. C. elegans is a suitable system for studying
              parasitic nematode genes that may be involved in drug resistance.",

              stress-resistance to Caenorhabditis elegans. These traits, unique
              to second-generation homozygotes, are blunted at the first
              generation and are largely reversed by additional mutations to
              DAF-16 ⁄ FOXO, a transcription factor downstream of AGE-1 in
              insulin-like signaling. The strong age-1 alleles (mg44, m333)
              were compared with the weaker hx546 allele on expression
              microarrays, testing four independent cohorts of each allele.
              Among 276 genes with significantly differential expression, 92\%
              showed fewer transcripts in adults carrying strong age-1 alleles
              rather than hx546. This proportion is significantly greater than
              the slight bias observed when contrasting age-1 alleles to
              wild-type worms. Thus, transcriptional changes peculiar to
              nonsense alleles primarily involve either gene silencing or
              failure of transcriptional activation. A subset of genes
              responding preferentially to age-1-nonsense alleles was
              reassessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, in worms
              bearing strong or weak age-1 alleles; nearly all of these were
              significantly more responsive to the age-1(mg44) allele than to
              age-1(hx546). Additional mutation of daf-16 reverted the majority
              of altered mg44-F2 expression levels to approximately wild-type
              values, although a substantial number of genes remained
              significantly distinct from wild-type, implying that age-1(mg44)
              modulates transcription through both DAF-16 ⁄ FOXO-dependent
              and)independent channels. When age-1-inhibited genes were
              targeted by RNA interference (RNAi) in wild-type or age-1(hx546)
              adults, most conferred significant oxidative-stress protection.
              RNAi constructs targeting two of those genes were shown
              previously to extend life, and RNAi's targeting five novel genes
              were found here to increase lifespan. PI3K-null mutants may thus

               larval types, obligate planktotrophic and facultative
               planktotrophic. This study compares the early cleavage of both
               forms of S. benedicti to that of a recently described (Rice and
               Levin 1998), closely related species, Streblospio
               gynobranchiata, which exhibits obligate planktotrophic
               development. Embryos were evaluated for blastomere and polar
               lobe size and the rate of the first four cleavages. All three
               Streblospio populations possessed large polar lobes and the 2d
               cell was equal to if not larger than the 2D cell; thus, these
               cleavage traits are likely selectively conserved because of
               their functional importance. Although there were significant
               differences between S. benedicti obligate planktotrophs and
               facultative planktotrophs, the S. benedicti and S.
               gynobranchiata obligate planktotrophic populations were
               identical in all respects. For example, embryos of both obligate
               planktotrophs formed equal-sized 1c and 1d micromeres that were
               larger than the 1a and 1b micromeres, while the facultative
               planktotrophs had equal-sized first quartet micromeres. The
               identical cleavage pattern of the two obligate planktotrophic
               Streblospio populations indicates that some early developmental
               patterns reflect larval developmental needs and not adult
               differences. The embryological differences between the two
               Streblospio obligate planktotrophs and the S. benedicti
               facultative planktotroph were unexpected as the former appeared
               to be more derived. This study has shown that the Streblospio

  abstract = "Investigating developmental evolution usually requires comparing
              differences across related species to infer how phenotypic change
              results from embryological modifications. However, when comparing
              organisms from different environments, ecologies, and
              evolutionary histories there can be many confounding factors to
              finding a genetic basis for developmental differences. In the
              marine annelid Streblospio benedicti, there are two distinct
              types of offspring with independent developmental pathways that
              converge on the same adult phenotype. To my knowledge, S.
              benedicti is the only known species that has heritable (additive)
              genetic variation in developmental traits that results in
              alternative life-history strategies. Females produce either
              hundreds of small, swimming and feeding larvae, or dozens of
              large, nonfeeding larvae. The larvae differ in their morphology,
              ecology, and dispersal potential. This developmental dimorphism
              makes S. benedicti a unique and useful model for understanding
              how genetic changes result in developmental modifications that
              ultimately lead to overall life-history differences. Because the
              offspring phenotypes of S. benedicti are heritable, we can use
              forward genetics within a single evolutionary lineage to

              the beginning of the 1990s. PF1022A, the starting material of
              emodepside, is a natural secondary metabolite of the fungus
              Mycelia sterilia, which belongs to the microflora of the leaves
              of Camellia japonica. PF1022A consists of four
              N-methyl-L-leucins, two D-Iactic acids and two D-phenyllactic
              acids, which build up a cyclic octadepsipeptide with an
              alternating L-D-L-configuration. Emodepside is a semisynthetic
              derivative of PF1022A, which contains a morpholine attached in
              para position at each of both D-phenyllactic acids. Emodepside is
              efficacious against a variety of gastrointestinal nematodes.
              Emodepside binds to a presynaptic latrophilin receptor in
              nematodes. The following presynaptic signal transduction occurs
              via activation of Gqalpha protein and phospholipase-Cbeta, which
              leads to mobilization of diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG then activates
              UNC-13 and synaptobrevin, two proteins which play an important
              role in presynaptic vesicle-functioning. This finally leads to
              the release of a currently unidentified transmitter. The
              transmitter (or modulator) exerts its effects at the postsynaptic

  author   = "Beech, R N and Silvestre, A",
  abstract = "A major concern for helminth parasite control in human and animal
              health is the development of anthelmintic resistance. The
              mutations that lead to such resistance do so in several ways
              including, loss of drug binding, modification of response once
              the drug has bound and loss of the drug target altogether.
              Benzimidazole resistance is best characterized by amino acid
              substitutions at three positions of the beta-tubulin protein:
              F167Y, E198A and F200Y, each of which causes loss of drug
              binding. Macrocyclic lactone resistance has been linked in the
              laboratory to mutations in different ligand-gated
              chloride-channel subunit genes, Hco-glc-5, Hco-lgc-37 and
              Con-avr-14 with substitutions A159V, K159R and L256F. These alter
              the channel response to drug binding, reducing its effects, which
              can also be seen in vivo. Levamisole resistance, including
              pyrantel and other related compounds, has been more difficult to
              characterize. More recently, loss of specific acetylcholine gated
              ion-channels that are targeted by the drug has been demonstrated
              with functional and molecular evidence. The loss of specific
              ion-channel targets of both the macrocyclic lactones and the new
              monepantel also seems to be a more general mechanism of
              anthelmintic resistance that requires further study. Praziquantel
              resistance is associated with SNPs in the subunit forming
              voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. By placing our knowledge of the

              biochemistry, functional characteristics, population genetics and
              effects in vivo gives us a more comprehensive understanding of

              reposition ivermectin for the treatment of other diseases that
              are not caused by helminth and insect parasites. The standard

              that it is a selective positive allosteric modulator of
              glutamate-gated chloride channels found in nematodes and insects.
              At higher concentrations, ivermectin also acts as an allosteric
              modulator of ion channels found in host central nervous systems.
              In addition, in tissue culture, at concentrations higher than
              anthelmintic concentrations, ivermectin shows antiviral,

               health problem for animals in different parts of the globe.
               Control of helminthiasis has largely relied on the use of
               pharmaceutical anthelmintics. Unfortunately, the exhaustive use
               of anthelmintic drugs has led to a serious and dramatic level of
               anthelmintic resistance. Anthelmintic resistance is a heritable
               loss of sensitivity of an anthelmintic in a parasite population
               that was in the past susceptible to the same anthelmintic. The
               development of anthelmintic resistance is evident to different
               helminths of almost every animal species and to different groups
               of anthelmintic in several continents. Frequent treatment,
               underdosing, genetics of the parasite, and targeting and timing
               of mass treatment are predisposing factors for anthelmintic
               resistance. Upregulation of cellular efflux mechanisms, an
               increase in drug metabolism, a change in drug receptor sites
               that reduces drug binding or the functional consequences of drug
               binding, and a decrease in drug receptor abundance through
               reduced expression within the parasite are the main mechanisms
               of anthelmintic resistance. In vivo method like fecal egg count
               reduction test and in vitro method such as egg hatch assays,
               larval motility test, larval development test and PCR can be
               used for the detection of anthelmintic resistance. Proper
               utilization of anthelmintic drugs, using combined anthelmintic
               and applying other alternatives are essential strategies to slow
               down the development of anthelmintic resistance. As anthelmintic
               resistance is a serious challenge throughout the world, proper
               utilization of the existing anthelmintics and reducing
               dependence on anthelmintics should be implemented to reduce its

  abstract = "Three anthelmintic classes with distinct mechanisms of action are
              commercially available. Selection of nematode populations
              resistant to all these drugs has occurred, particularly in
              trichostrongyloid parasites of sheep. Anthelmintic resistance in
              cattle parasites has only recently been recognized and appears to
              be less pronounced, even though very similar species infect both
              hosts. To understand the bases for differences in the rate of
              resistance development in sheep versus cattle parasites, it is
              important to first demonstrate that the same kinds of resistance
              alleles exist in both. The benzimidazoles (BZ), which have been
              used for more than 40 years, were chosen as an example.
              BZ-sensitive (BZS) and BZ-resistant (BZR) nematodes that
              parasitize sheep have been distinguished at the molecular level
              by a single nucleotide change in the codon for amino acid 200 of
              a $\beta$-tubulin gene, a switch from TT̄C (phenylalanine) to
              TĀC (tyrosine). PCR primers were designed to completely
              conserved regions of trichostrongyloid $\beta$-tubulin genes and
              were used to amplify DNA fragments from Haemonchus contortus
              (cDNA from a BZS and a BZR library) as positive controls. The
              technique was then extended to the cattle parasites, Cooperia
              oncophora and Ostertagia ostertagi (from genomic DNA). Sequence
              analysis proved the presence of amplified BZS alleles in all
              three species and BZR alleles in the BZR population of H.
              contortus. Based on these data, nested PCR primers using the
              diagnostic T̄ or Ā as the most 3′ nucleotide were designed for
              each species. Conditions for selective PCR were determined. To
              demonstrate feasibility, genomic DNA was recovered from
              individual H. contortus L3 larvae from both BZS and BZR
              populations. Genomic DNA was also isolated from >70 individual
              adult male C. oncophora collected from a cattle farm in New
              Zealand with reported BZ resistance. Allele-specific PCR
              discriminated among heterozygotes and homozygotes in both
              species. This method could find utility in studying the molecular
              epidemiology of BZ resistance in cattle parasites and for
              defining the variables that limit the development and spread of
              anthelmintic resistance in this host.",

               strategy and the potential for reversion towards susceptibility",
  author    = "Leathwick, Dave M",
  abstract  = "The rotation of different anthelmintic classes, on an
               approximately annual basis, has been widely promoted and adopted
               as a strategy to delay the development of anthelmintic
               resistance in nematode parasites. Part of the rationale for
               recommending this practice was the expectation that resistant
               genotype worms have a lower ecological fitness than susceptible
               worms, at least in the early stages of selection, and so
               reversion towards susceptibility could be expected in those
               years when an alternative class of anthelmintic was used. The
               routine use of combination anthelmintics might be expected to
               negate this opportunity for reversion because multiple classes
               of anthelmintic would be used simultaneously. A simulation model
               was used to investigate whether the optimal strategy for use of
               multiple drug classes (i.e. an annual rotation of two classes of
               anthelmintic or continuous use of two classes in combination)
               changed with the size of the fitness cost associated with
               resistance. Model simulations were run in which the fitness cost
               associated with each resistance gene was varied from 0\% to 15\%
               and the rate at which resistance developed was compared for each
               of the drug-use strategies. Other factors evaluated were the
               initial frequency of the resistance genes and the proportion of
               the population not exposed to treatment (i.e. in refugia).
               Increasing the proportion of the population in refugia always
               slowed the development of resistance, as did using combinations
               in preference to an annual rotation. As the fitness cost
               associated with resistance increased, resistance developed more
               slowly and this was more pronounced when a combination was used
               compared to a rotation. If the fitness cost was sufficiently
               high then resistance did not develop (i.e. the resistance gene
               frequency declined over time) and this occurred at lower fitness
               costs when a combination was used. The results, therefore,
               indicate that the optimal drug-use strategy to maximise the
               benefit of any fitness cost associated with resistance is the
               use of combinations of different anthelmintic classes. Manual
               calculations confirmed that, within the model, the only
               resistant genotypes capable of surviving treatment with a
               combination are those carrying multiple resistance genes. These
               individuals are less fit, resulting in the worm population
               surviving treatment having a lower overall ecological fitness.
               This is a previously unreported perspective on the use of
               combination anthelmintics and strengthens the argument that any
               new class of anthelmintic, for which resistance genes can be
               expected to be rare, should be brought to market in combination.",

              viewed as parasitic or ``selfish DNA''. However, transposons may
              have been beneficial for their hosts as genome evolution drivers,
              thus providing an example of molecular mutualism. Interactions
              between transposon and C. elegans research were undoubtedly

              analyzing C. elegans. Suppression experiments are facilitated by
              the ability to handle very large numbers of individuals and to
              apply powerful selections. Because the animal grows as a
              self-fertilizing diploid, both dominant and recessive suppressors
              can be recovered. Many different kinds of suppression have been
              reported. These are discussed by category, with examples,
              together with discussion of how suppressors can be used to
              interpret the underlying biology, and to enable further
              experimentation. Suppression phenomena can be divided into
              intragenic and extragenic classes, depending on whether the
              suppressor lies in the same gene as the starting mutation, or in
              a different gene. Intragenic types include same-site replacement,
              compensatory mutation, alteration in splicing, and reversion of
              dominant mutations by cis-knockout. Extragenic suppression can
              occur by a variety of informational mechanisms, such as
              alterations in splicing, translation or nonsense-mediated decay.
              In addition, extragenic suppression can occur by bypass, dosage
              effects, product interaction, or removal of toxic products.
              Within signaling pathways, suppression can occur by modulating
              the strength of signal transmission, or by epistatic interactions
              that can reveal the underlying regulatory hierarchies. In C.

              for sensitive, scalable and accurate diagnostic tools to detect
              the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. Detecting and measuring
              the frequency of resistance-associated mutations in parasite
              populations has the potential to provide sensitive and
              quantitative assessment of resistance emergence from an early

              are multiple co-infecting trichostrongylid nematode species, each

              resistance allele frequencies, and can reliably detect resistance
              alleles down to a frequency of 0.1\%, making it particularly

              Noteworthy, an E198L substitution was present in 82\% of the
              samples (L3 and adults) including all post-treatment samples.
              Moreover, E198V, E198K and potentially E198I, and E198Stop were
              identified in a few samples. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this
              is the first report of E198L in BZ resistant H. contortus and the
              second where this is the predominant genotype associated with
              resistance in any strongyle species. Since this variant cannot be
              quantified using pyrosequencing, the results highlight important
              limitations in the general applicability of pyrosequencing to
              quantify BZ resistance genotypes.",

              twenty-nine mRNAs encoding drug targets and P-glycoproteins

              passaged isolate. Expression levels of some nicotinic
              acetylcholine receptor mRNAs were markedly different in UGA/2004.
              Levels of the Hco-acr-8b mRNA, encoding a truncated subunit, were
              very high in resistant L3, but undetectable in susceptible
              larvae, with expression of the full-length Hco-acr-8a mRNA also
              significant increased. Expression of Hco-unc-63 and Hco-unc-29.3
              mRNAs was significantly reduced in the resistant larvae.
              Expression of the Hco-glc-3 and Hco-glc-5 mRNAs, encoding

              control of parasitic infections in humans and animals. However,
              recently reports of treatment failures became more frequent. In
              addition to human and ruminant parasitic nematodes this also is
              the case for the horse-nematode Parascaris equorum. Nevertheless,
              to date the molecular basis of ML resistance is still not
              understood. Unspecific resistance mechanisms involving
              transporters such as P-glycoproteins (Pgps) are expected to
              contribute to ML resistance in nematodes. Here, complete
              sequences of two P. equorum Pgps were cloned and identified as
              orthologs of Caenorhabditis elegans Ppg-11 and an unnamed
              Caenorhabditis briggsae Pgp designated as Pgp-16 using
              phylogenetic analysis. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to
              compare expression between tissues. Significantly higher
              PeqPgp-11 expression was found in the gut for both genders,
              whereas for PeqPgp-16 the body wall was identified as predominant
              expression site. Furthermore, Pgps were analyzed regarding their
              participation in resistance development. Using SeqDoC analyses,
              Pgp-sequences of P. equorum populations with different ML
              susceptibility were compared. This approach revealed three single
              nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) causing missense mutations in the
              PeqPgp-11 sequence which correlated with decreased ML
              susceptibility. However, no resistance associated differences in
              mRNA expression levels were detected between embryonated eggs of
              these populations. In contrast, comparison of two pre-adult
              groups with different ivermectin (IVM) susceptibility revealed
              the presence of the three SNPs and in addition statistically
              significant PeqPgp-11 overexpression in the group of worms with
              reduced susceptibility. These results indicate that Pgp-11 might
              be involved in IVM resistance in P. equorum as it shows increased
              expression in an IVM exposed life-cycle stage of an IVM resistant
              population as well as occurrence of putatively resistance
              associated SNPs in populations with reduced IVM susceptibility.
              These SNPs are promising diagnostic candidates for detection of

              paralysis and slow the growth of the nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans. We have identified 28 mutations in C. elegans that
              confer resistance to benzimidazoles. All resistant mutations map
              to a single locus, ben-1. Virtually all these mutations are
              genetically dominant. Molecular cloning and DNA sequence analysis
              established that ben-1 encodes a beta-tubulin. Some resistant
              mutants are completely deleted for the ben-1 gene. Since the
              deletion strains appear to be fully resistant to the drugs, the
              ben-1 product appears to be the only benzimidazole-sensitive
              beta-tubulin in C. elegans. Furthermore, since animals lacking
              ben-1 are viable and coordinated, the ben-1 beta-tubulin appears
              to be nonessential for growth and movement. The ben-1 function is
              likely to be redundant in the nematode genome.",

              resistance is now widespread in many species of parasitic
              nematodes in livestock globally and an emerging concern for the
              sustainable control of human soil-transmitted helminths.
              $\beta$-tubulin is the major benzimidazole target, although other
              genes may influence resistance. Among the 6 Caenorhabditis
              elegans $\beta$-tubulin genes, loss of ben-1 causes resistance
              without other apparent defects. Here, we explored the genetics of
              C. elegans $\beta$-tubulin genes in relation to the response to
              the benzimidazole derivative albendazole. The most highly
              expressed $\beta$-tubulin isotypes, encoded by tbb-1 and tbb-2,
              were known to be redundant with each other for viability, and
              their products are predicted not to bind benzimidazoles. We found
              that tbb-2 mutants, and to a lesser extent tbb-1 mutants, were
              hypersensitive to albendazole. The double mutant tbb-2 ben-1 is
              uncoordinated and short, resembling the wild type exposed to
              albendazole, but the tbb-1 ben-1 double mutant did not show the
              same phenotypes. These results suggest that tbb-2 is a modifier
              of albendazole sensitivity. To better understand how BEN-1
              mutates to cause benzimidazole resistance, we isolated mutants
              resistant to albendazole and found that 15 of 16 mutations
              occurred in the ben-1 coding region. Mutations ranged from likely
              nulls to hypomorphs, and several corresponded to residues that
              cause resistance in other organisms. Null alleles of ben-1 are
              albendazole-resistant and BEN-1 shows high sequence identity with
              tubulins from other organisms, suggesting that many amino acid
              changes could cause resistance. However, our results suggest that
              missense mutations conferring resistance are not evenly
              distributed across all possible conserved sites. Independent of
              their roles in benzimidazole resistance, tbb-1 and tbb-2 may have

              However, the computational tools for identifying important genes

              annotations and are biased toward well-described pathways. This
              limits their utility as poorly annotated genes, which could have
              novel functions, are often passed over. Recently, we developed an
              annotation and category enrichment tool for Caenorhabditis
              elegans genomic data, WormCat, that provides an intuitive
              visualization output. Unlike GO-based enrichment tools, which
              exclude genes with no annotation information, WormCat 2.0 retains
              these genes as a special UNASSIGNED category. Here, we show that
              the UNASSIGNED gene category enrichment exhibits tissue-specific
              expression patterns and can include genes with biological
              functions identified in published datasets. Poorly annotated
              genes are often considered to be potentially species-specific and
              thus, of reduced interest to the biomedical community. Instead,
              we find that around 3\% of the UNASSIGNED genes have human
              orthologs, including some linked to human diseases. These human
              orthologs themselves have little annotation information. A
              recently developed method that incorporates lineage relationships
              (abSENSE) indicates that failure of BLAST to detect homology
              explains the apparent lineage specificity for many UNASSIGNED

              human genes. WormCat provides an annotation strategy that allows
              association of UNASSIGNED genes with specific phenotypes and
              known pathways. Building these associations in C. elegans, with

              elegans has caused a wealth of new information regarding its life
              outside of the laboratory. The intensified search for C. elegans
              in nature has contributed to the discovery of many new
              Caenorhabditis species and revealed that congeneric nematodes
              frequently cohabitate in the wild, where they feed on microbial
              blooms associated with rotting plant material. The identification
              of new species has also revealed that the androdioecious mating
              system of males and self-fertilizing hermaphrodites has evolved

              pests, and benzimidazoles are amongst the most important broad
              spectrum anthelmintic drug class used for their control.
              Benzimidazole resistance is now widespread in many species of
              parasitic nematodes in livestock globally and an emerging concern
              for the sustainable control of human soil transmitted helminths.
              $\beta$-tubulin is the major benzimidazole target, although other
              genes may influence resistance. Among the six C. elegans
              $\beta$-tubulin genes, loss of ben-1 causes resistance without
              other apparent defects. Here, we explored the genetics of C.
              elegans $\beta$-tubulin genes in relation to the response to the
              benzimidazole derivative albendazole. The most highly expressed
              $\beta$-tubulin isotypes, encoded by tbb-1 and tbb-2, were known
              to be redundant with each other for viability, and their products
              are predicted not to bind benzimidazoles. We found that tbb-2
              mutants, and to a lesser extent tbb-1 mutants, were
              hypersensitive to albendazole. The double mutant tbb-2 ben-1 is
              uncoordinated and dumpy, resembling the wild type exposed to
              albendazole, but the tbb-1 ben-1 double mutant did not show the
              same phenotype. These results suggest that tbb-2 is a modifier of
              ABZ sensitivity. To better understand how BEN-1 mutates to cause
              benzimidazole resistance, we isolated mutants resistant to
              albendazole and found that 15 of 16 mutations occurred in ben-1.
              Mutations ranged from likely nulls to hypomorphs, and several
              corresponded to residues that cause resistance in other
              organisms. Null alleles of ben-1 are albendazole-resistant and
              BEN-1 shows high sequence identity with tubulins from other
              organisms, suggesting that many amino acid changes could cause
              resistance. However, our results suggest that missense mutations
              conferring resistance are not evenly distributed across all
              possible conserved sites. Independent of their roles in
              benzimidazole resistance, tbb-1 and tbb-2 may have specialized
              functions as null mutants of tbb-1 or tbb-2 were cold or heat
              sensitive, respectively.",

              signatures of drug selection in parasite populations in the
              field. However, their application to parasitic nematodes has been
              limited because of both a lack of suitable reference genomes and
              the difficulty of obtaining field populations with sufficiently
              well-defined drug selection histories. Consequently, there is
              little information on the genomic signatures of drug selection
              for parasitic nematodes in the field and on how best to detect
              them. This study was designed to address these knowledge gaps
              using field populations of Haemonchus contortus with well-defined
              and contrasting benzimidazole-selection histories, leveraging a
              recently completed chromosomal-scale reference genome assembly.
              We generated a panel of 49,393 ddRADseq markers and used this
              resource to genotype 20 individual H. contortus adult worms from
              each of four H. contortus populations: two from closed sheep
              flocks that had an approximately 20-year history of frequent
              treatment exclusively with benzimidazole drugs, and two
              populations with a history of little or no drug treatment. The
              populations were chosen from the same geographical region to
              limit population structure in order to maximize the sensitivity
              of the approach. A clear signature of selection was detected on
              the left arm of chromosome I centered on the isotype-1
              $\beta$-tubulin gene in the benzimidazole-selected but not the
              unselected populations. Two additional, but weaker, signatures of
              selection were detected; one near the middle of chromosome I and
              one near the isotype-2 $\beta$-tubulin locus on chromosome II. We
              examined genetic differentiation between populations, and
              nucleotide diversity and linkage disequilibrium within
              populations to define these two additional regions as
              encompassing five genes and a single gene. We also compared the
              relative power of using pooled versus individual worm sequence
              data to detect genomic selection signatures and how sensitivity
              is impacted by sequencing depth, worm number, and population
              structure.In summary, this study used H. contortus field
              populations with well-defined drug selection histories to provide

              anthelmintic drugs for human and animal parasitic nematode
              control with ∼0.5 billion children at risk of infection treated
              annually worldwide. Drug resistance is common in livestock
              parasites and a growing concern in humans. Haemonchus contortus
              is the most important model parasite system used to study
              anthelmintic resistance and a significant livestock pathogen. It
              is also one of the few parasitic nematodes with a
              chromosomal-scale genome assembly. We have undertaken genome-wide
              scans using a dense RADseq marker panel on worms from natural
              field populations under differing levels of benzimidazole
              selection. We show that there is a single predominant genomic
              signature of selection in H. contortus associated with
              benzimidazole selection centred on the isotype-1 $\beta$-tubulin
              locus. We also identify two weaker signatures of selection
              indicative of secondary drug resistance loci. Additionally, we
              assess the minimum data requirements for parameters including
              worm number, sequence depth, marker density needed to detect the
              signatures of selection and compare individual to Poolseq
              analysis. This work is the first genome-wide study in a parasitic
              nematode to provide direct evidence of the isotype-1
              $\beta$-tubulin locus being the single predominant benzimidazole
              resistance locus and provides an experimental framework for
              future population genomic studies on anthelmintic resistance.",

              burdens worldwide. We use anthelmintic drugs to reduce these

              extremely common and increasing worldwide. It is essential to
              understand the mechanisms of resistance to slow its spread.
              Recently, four new parasitic nematode beta-tubulin alleles have
              been identified in benzimidazole (BZ) resistant parasite
              populations: E198I, E198K, E198T, and E198stop. These alleles
              have not been tested for the ability to confer resistance or for
              any effects that they might have on organismal fitness. We
              introduced these four new alleles into the sensitive C. elegans
              laboratory-adapted N2 strain and exposed these genome-edited
              strains to both albendazole and fenbendazole. We found that all
              four alleles conferred resistance to both BZ drugs. Additionally,
              we tested for fitness consequences in both control and
              albendazole conditions over seven generations in competitive
              fitness assays. We found that none of the edited alleles had
              deleterious effects on fitness in control conditions and that all
              four alleles conferred strong and equivalent fitness benefits in
              BZ drug conditions. Because it is unknown if previously validated
              alleles confer a dominant or recessive BZ resistance phenotype,
              we tested the phenotypes caused by five of these alleles and
              found that none of them conferred a dominant BZ resistance
              phenotype. Accurate measurements of resistance, fitness effects,
              and dominance caused by the resistance alleles allow for the

              population size change, population substructure, genome
              structure, and nonrandom mating. Although inference methods aim

              nonrandom mating remains incompletely understood, despite being a
              common feature of many species. We report the DFE estimated from
              326 genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode roundworm with
              a high rate of self-fertilization. We evaluate the robustness of

              of parasitic nematodes. The emerging threat of BZ resistance
              among multiple nematode species necessitates the development of
              novel strategies to identify genetic and molecular mechanisms
              underlying this resistance. All detection of parasitic helminth
              resistance to BZ is focused on the genotyping of three variant
              sites in the orthologs of the $\beta$-tubulin gene found to
              confer resistance in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans. Because of the limitations of laboratory and field
              experiments in parasitic nematodes, it is difficult to look
              beyond these three sites to identify additional mechanisms that
              might contribute to BZ resistance in the field. Here, we took an
              unbiased genome-wide mapping approach in the free-living nematode
              species C. elegans to identify the genetic underpinnings of
              natural resistance to the commonly used BZ, albendazole (ABZ). We
              found a wide range of natural variation in ABZ resistance in
              natural C. elegans populations. In agreement with known
              mechanisms of BZ resistance in parasites, we found that a
              majority of the variation in ABZ resistance among wild C. elegans
              strains is caused by variation in the $\beta$-tubulin gene ben-1.
              This result shows empirically that resistance to ABZ naturally
              exists and segregates within the C. elegans population,
              suggesting that selection in natural niches could enrich for
              resistant alleles. We identified 25 distinct ben-1 alleles that
              are segregating at low frequencies within the C. elegans
              population, including many novel molecular variants. Population
              genetic analyses indicate that ben-1 variation arose multiple
              times during the evolutionary history of C. elegans and provide
              evidence that these alleles likely occurred recently because of
              local selective pressures. Additionally, we find purifying
              selection at all five $\beta$-tubulin genes, despite predicted
              loss-of-function variants in ben-1, indicating that BZ resistance
              in natural niches is a stronger selective pressure than loss of
              one $\beta$-tubulin gene. Furthermore, we used genome-editing to
              show that the most common parasitic nematode $\beta$-tubulin
              allele that confers BZ resistance, F200Y, confers resistance in
              C. elegans. Importantly, we identified a novel genomic region
              that is correlated with ABZ resistance in the C. elegans
              population but independent of ben-1 and the other $\beta$-tubulin
              loci, suggesting that there are multiple mechanisms underlying BZ
              resistance. Taken together, our results establish a
              population-level resource of nematode natural diversity as an
              important model for the study of mechanisms that give rise to BZ

              health of humans and livestock throughout the world. Anthelmintic
              drugs are the first line of defense against these infections.
              Unfortunately, resistance to these drugs is rampant and continues
              to spread. To improve treatment strategies, we must understand
              the genetics and molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance.
              Studies of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans and the free-living
              nematode Caenorhabditis elegans discovered that a beta-tubulin
              gene is mutated in benzimidazole (BZ) resistant strains. In
              parasitic nematode populations, three beta-tubulin alleles,
              F167Y, E198A, and F200Y, have long been correlated with
              resistance. Additionally, improvements in sequencing technologies
              have identified new alleles - E198V, E198L, E198K, E198I, and
              E198Stop - also correlated with BZ resistance. However, none of
              these alleles have been proven to cause resistance. To
              empirically demonstrate this point, we independently introduced
              the F167Y, E198A, and F200Y alleles as well as two of the newly
              identified alleles, E198V and E198L, into the BZ susceptible C.

              genome-edited strains were exposed to both albendazole and
              fenbendazole to quantitatively measure animal responses to BZs.
              We used a range of concentrations for each BZ compound to define
              response curves and found that all five of the alleles conferred
              resistance to BZ compounds equal to a loss of the entire
              beta-tubulin gene. These results prove that the parasite
              beta-tubulin alleles cause resistance. The E198V allele is found
              at low frequencies along with the E198L allele in natural
              parasite populations, suggesting that it could affect fitness. We
              performed competitive fitness assays and demonstrated that the
              E198V allele reduces animal health, supporting the hypothesis
              that this allele might be less fit in field populations. Overall,

               Against that backdrop, Upjohn Animal Health (now Pfizer Animal
               Health) established a discovery program to identify compounds
               with novel modes of action and effective against several
               important nematode species, including strains resistant to the
               major classes of anthelmintics. This testing led to the

               the spiroindole class of anthelmintics with commercial utility.
               Derquantel was prepared semisynthetically by chemical reduction

               Penicillium simplicissimum. It was subsequently shown that

               experimental designs in model organisms are used to uncover the

               despite the biological plausibility that nonlinear molecular
               interactions underpin the genotype--phenotype map. This
               controversy arises because most genetic variation for

              the first time, that the pattern holds for the X chromosome as
              well. The terminal domains of each chromosome, spanning about 7\%
              of the genome, exhibit effectively no recombination. The RIAILs

              RESULTS: Here we report on the identification of genomic
              differences between the reference strain N2 and the Hawaiian
              strain CB4856, one of the most genetically distant strains from
              N2. To identify both small- and large-scale genomic variations
              (GVs), we have sequenced the CB4856 genome using both Roche 454
              (~400 bps single reads) and Illumina GA DNA sequencing methods
              (101 bps paired-end reads). Compared to previously described
              variants (available in WormBase), our effort uncovered twice as
              many single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and increased the number
              of small InDels almost 20-fold. Moreover, we identified and
              validated large insertions, most of which range from 150 bps to
              1.2 kb in length in the CB4856 strain. Identified GVs had a
              widespread impact on protein-coding sequences, including 585
              single-copy genes that have associated severe phenotypes of
              reduced viability in RNAi and genetics studies. Sixty of these
              genes are homologs of human genes associated with diseases.
              Furthermore, our work confirms previously identified GVs
              associated with differences in behavioural and biological traits
              between the N2 and CB4856 strains. CONCLUSIONS: The identified

              phenotypically expressed under a strong perturbation. Genetic
              variation that is cryptic relative to a robust trait may
              accumulate neutrally as it does not change the phenotype, yet it
              could also evolve under selection if it affects traits related to
              fitness in addition to its cryptic effect. Cryptic variation
              affecting the vulval intercellular signaling network was
              previously uncovered among wild isolates of Caenorhabditis
              elegans. Using a quantitative genetic approach, we identify a
              non-synonymous polymorphism of the previously uncharacterized
              nath-10 gene that affects the vulval phenotype when the system is
              sensitized with different mutations, but not in wild-type
              strains. nath-10 is an essential protein acetyltransferase gene
              and the homolog of human NAT10. The nath-10 polymorphism also
              presents non-cryptic effects on life history traits. The nath-10
              allele carried by the N2 reference strain leads to a subtle
              increase in the egg laying rate and in the total number of sperm,
              a trait affecting the trade-off between fertility and minimal
              generation time in hermaphrodite individuals. We show that this
              allele appeared during early laboratory culture of N2, which
              allowed us to test whether it may have evolved under selection in

              These results show that cryptic genetic variation does not
              necessarily accumulate neutrally at the whole-organism level, but
              may evolve through selection for pleiotropic effects that alter
              fitness. In addition, cultivation in the laboratory has led to
              adaptive evolution of the reference strain N2 to the laboratory

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Organisms live in environments that vary. For
              life-history traits that vary across environments, fitness will
              be maximised when the phenotype is appropriately matched to the
              environmental conditions. For the free-living nematode
              Caenorhabditis elegans, we have investigated how two major
              life-history traits, (i) the development of environmentally
              resistant dauer larvae and (ii) reproduction, respond to
              environmental stress (high population density and low food
              availability), and how these traits vary between lines and the
              genetic basis of this variation. RESULTS: We found that lines of
              C. elegans vary in their phenotypic plasticity of dauer larva
              development, i.e. there is variation in the likelihood of
              developing into a dauer larva for the same environmental change.
              There was also variation in how lifetime fecundity and the rate
              of reproduction changed under conditions of environmental stress.
              These traits were related, such that lines that are highly
              plastic for dauer larva development also maintain a high
              population growth rate when stressed. We identified quantitative
              trait loci (QTL) on two chromosomes that control the dauer larva
              development and population size phenotypes. The QTLs affecting
              the dauer larva development and population size phenotypes on
              chromosome II are closely linked, but are genetically separable.
              This chromosome II QTL controlling dauer larva development does
              not encompass any loci previously identified to control dauer
              larva development. This chromosome II region contains many
              predicted 7-transmembrane receptors. Such proteins are often
              involved in information transduction, which is clearly relevant
              to the control of dauer larva development. CONCLUSION: C. elegans
              alters both its larval development and adult reproductive
              strategy in response to environmental stress. Together the
              phenotypic and genotypic data suggest that these two major
              life-history traits are co-ordinated responses to environmental
              stress and that they are, at least in part, controlled by the
              same genomic regions.",

              mouse strains is a promising approach for the identification of

              association studies in inbred model organisms are confronted by
              the problem of complex population structure among strains. This
              induces inflated false positive rates, which cannot be corrected
              using standard approaches applied in human association studies
              such as genomic control or structured association. Recent studies
              demonstrated that mixed models successfully correct for the
              genetic relatedness in association mapping in maize and
              Arabidopsis panel data sets. However, the currently available
              mixed-model methods suffer from computational inefficiency. In
              this article, we propose a new method, efficient mixed-model

              genetic relatedness in model organism association mapping. Our
              method takes advantage of the specific nature of the optimization

              allows us to substantially increase the computational speed and

              under various SNP effects, varying degrees of population

              strain. Despite the limited power of inbred mouse association
              mapping due to the limited number of available inbred strains, we

              released. SAMtools implements various utilities for
              post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing,
              variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal

              small fraction of them identified in most studies. Traditional
              data processing pipelines contain an alignment step to assemble
              the measurements of overlapping features across samples into a
              unified table. However, data sets acquired under nonidentical
              conditions are not amenable to this process, mostly due to
              significant alterations in chromatographic retention times.
              Alignment of features between disparately acquired LC-MS
              metabolomics data could aid collaborative compound identification
              efforts and enable meta-analyses of expanded data sets. Here, we
              describe metabCombiner, a new computational pipeline for matching
              known and unknown features in a pair of untargeted LC-MS data
              sets and concatenating their abundances into a combined table of
              intersecting feature measurements. metabCombiner groups features
              by mass-to-charge (m/z) values to generate a search space of
              possible feature pair alignments, fits a spline through a set of
              selected retention time ordered pairs, and ranks alignments by
              m/z, mapped retention time, and relative abundance similarity. We
              evaluated this workflow on a pair of plasma metabolomics data
              sets acquired with different gradient elution methods, achieving
              a mean absolute retention time prediction error of roughly 0.06
              min and a weighted per-compound matching accuracy of
              approximately 90\%. We further demonstrate the utility of this
              method by comprehensively mapping features in urine and muscle
              metabolomics data sets acquired from different laboratories.

              maintained in C. elegans because outcrossed individuals escape
              inbreeding depression. The level of inbreeding depression is,
              however, expected to be low in such a highly selfing species,

              In addition to various endogenous compounds, numerous xenobiotics
              are substrates of UGTs. As the glycosides formed are generally
              less active/toxic and more hydrophilic than aglycones, UGTs
              effectively protect organisms from potentially harmful
              xenobiotics. Therefore increased UGT expression and/or activity
              improves the protection of the organism and may contribute to the
              development of individuals that become more resistant to certain
              xenobiotics. While the function of UGTs in the resistance of
              human cancer cells to chemotherapy is now well known, other
              organisms and other xenobiotics have attracted much less
              attention. The present review was designed to fill this knowledge
              gap by presenting complex information about the role of UGTs in
              xenobiotic-resistance in various organisms. This summarization

              humans, but in countless other organisms such as parasites,
              insects, and plants. Moreover, many recent studies clearly show
              the participation of UGTs in the resistance of nematodes to
              anthelmintics, insects to insecticides, weeds to herbicides as
              well as humans to various drugs (not only those used in cancer

              xenobiotic resistance in diverse organisms has become obvious,

              likelihood, resulting in a number of studies investigating these
              questions in wild populations. Experimental manipulation of
              environmental quality in the wild, as well as the use of
              naturally occurring favourable or stressful environments, has
              broadened the treatment of different taxa and traits. Here, we
              conduct a meta-analysis on recent studies comparing heritability
              in favourable versus unfavourable conditions in non-domestic and
              non-laboratory animals. The results provide evidence for
              increased heritability in more favourable conditions,
              significantly so for morphometric traits but not for traits more
              closely related to fitness. We discuss how these results are
              explained by underlying changes in variance components, and how
              they represent a major step in our understanding of evolutionary
              processes in wild populations. We also show how these trends
              contrast with the prevailing view resulting mainly from
              laboratory experiments on Drosophila. Finally, we underline the
              importance of taking into account the environmental variation in
              models predicting quantitative trait evolution.",

              variation, namely that knowledge about biological pathways and
              gene networks imply that epistasis is important. Yet empirical
              data across a range of traits and species imply that most genetic
              variance is additive. We evaluate the evidence from empirical
              studies of genetic variance components and find that additive
              variance typically accounts for over half, and often close to
              100\%, of the total genetic variance. We present new theoretical
              results, based upon the distribution of allele frequencies under
              neutral and other population genetic models, that show why this

               posed by the wide-spread prevalence of parasitic nematodes.
               First, many anthelmintic drugs are losing their effectiveness
               because nematode strains with resistance are emerging. Second,
               serious concerns regarding the environmental impact of the
               nematicides used for crop protection have prompted legislation
               to remove them from use, leaving agriculture at increased risk
               from nematode pests. There is clearly a need for a concerted
               effort to address these challenges. Over the last few decades
               the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has provided the
               opportunity to use molecular genetic techniques for mode of
               action studies for anthelmintics and nematicides. These
               approaches continue to be of considerable value. Less fruitful
               so far, but nonetheless potentially very useful, has been the
               direct use of C. elegans for anthelmintic and nematicide
               discovery programmes. Here we provide an introduction to the use
               of C. elegans as a `model' parasitic nematode, briefly review
               the study of nematode control using C. elegans and highlight
               approaches that have been of particular value with a view to
               facilitating wider-use of C. elegans as a platform for
               anthelmintic and nematicide discovery and development",

  abstract  = "There are three major classes of anthelmintics for veterinary
               use: the benzimidazoles/prebenzimidazoles, the
               tetrahydropyrimidines/imidazothiazoles, and the macrocyclic
               lactones. In nematodes, there are five targets for the existing
               anthelmintics: the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor which is
               the target of tetrahydropyrimidines/imidazothiazoles and
               indirectly that of the acetylcholineesterase inhibitors; the
               GABA receptor which is the target of piperazine, the
               glutamate-gated chloride channel as the target of the
               macrocyclic lactones, and {\ss}-tubulin as the target of
               prebenzimidazoles/benzimidazoles. All these anthelmintics are
               now in serious danger because of the worldwide spread of
               resistant nematodes in sheep, cattle, horses and pigs. The class
               of cyclooctadepsipeptides has entered the scene of anthelmintic
               research in the early 1990s. PF1022A, the first anthelmintically
               active member, is a natural compound from the fungus Mycelia
               sterilia that belongs to the microflora of the leaves of the
               Camellia japonica. PF1022A contains 4 N-Methyl-l-leucines, 2
               d-lactic acids and 2-d-phenyllactic acids arranged as a cyclic
               octadepsipeptide with an alternating l-d-l-configuration.
               Emodepside is a semisynthetic derivative of PF1022A with a
               morpholine ring at each of the two d-phenyllactic acids in para
               position. The anthelmintic activity is directed against
               gastrointestinal nematodes in chicken, mice, rats, meriones,
               dogs, cats, sheep, cattle and horses. Moreover, emodepside is
               active against Trichinella spiralis larvae in muscles,
               microfilariae and preadult filariae and Dictyocaulus viviparus.
               PF1022A and emodepside are fully effective against
               benzimidazole-, levamisole or ivermectin-resistant nematodes in
               sheep and cattle. In Ascaris suum both cyclooctadepsipeptides
               lead to paralysis indicating a neuropharmacological action of
               these compounds. Using a PF1022A-ligand immunoscreening of a
               cDNA library from Haemonchus contortus a cDNA clone of 3569 base
               pairs could be identified. This clone codes for a novel 110 kDa
               heptahelical transmembrane receptor, named HC110R. Database- and
               phylogenetic analysis reveals that this receptor is a homolog to
               B0457.1 from Caenorhabditis elegans and has significant
               similarity to latrophilins from human, cattle and rat. HC110R is
               located in the plasma membrane and in lysosomes and endosomes.
               $\alpha$-Latrotoxin, the poison of the black widow spider, binds
               at a 54 kDa aminoterminal fragment of HC110R. After binding a
               Ca2+-influx into HEK293 cells is induced which can be blocked by
               EGTA, Cd2+ or nifedipin. PF1022A or emodepside also bind to this
               54 kDa aminoterminal region of HC110R and interact with the
               functional responses of $\alpha$-latrotoxin. In C. elegans
               antibodies against the C-or N-terminus of HC110R bind to the
               B0457.1 protein located in the pharynx. Electrophysiological
               studies reveal that emodepside inhibits pharyngeal pumping of
               the nematodes in a concentration dependent way with an IC50
               value of about 4 nM. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that
               emodepside exerts its action on nematodes via a latrophilin-like
               receptor which might have an important regulatory function on
               pharyngeal pumping.",

               helminthiasis (STH); the benzimidazoles albendazole and
               mebendazole are the only drugs being used for preventive
               chemotherapy as they can be given in one single dose with no
               weight adjustment. While generally safe and effective in
               reducing intensity of infection, they are contra-indicated in
               first-trimester pregnancy and have suboptimal efficacy against
               Trichuris trichiura. In addition, drug resistance is a threat.
               It is therefore important to find alternatives. METHODOLOGY: We
               searched the literature and the animal health marketed products
               and pipeline for potential drug development candidates. Recently
               registered veterinary products offer advantages in that they
               have undergone extensive and rigorous animal testing, thus
               reducing the risk, cost and time to approval for human trials.
               For selected compounds, we retrieved and summarised publicly
               available information (through US Freedom of Information (FoI)
               statements, European Public Assessment Reports (EPAR) and
               published literature). Concomitantly, we developed a target
               product profile (TPP) against which the products were compared.
               PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The paper summarizes the general findings
               including various classes of compounds, and more specific
               information on two veterinary anthelmintics (monepantel,
               emodepside) and nitazoxanide, an antiprotozoal drug, compiled
               from the EMA EPAR and FDA registration files.
               CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Few of the compounds already approved
               for use in human or animal medicine qualify for development
               track decision. Fast-tracking to approval for human studies may
               be possible for veterinary compounds like emodepside and

               activity. Members of this new class of potential drugs may also
               serve as lead compounds for more pharmacologically potent and
               toxicologically safe derivatives. Some of these natural products
               and (semi-)synthetic derivatives have already been evaluated in
               clinical trials. A common feature of cyclodepsipeptides is their
               ionophoric properties. However, their pharmacologically relevant
               action does not seem to correlate with this feature; rather it
               is based on interactions with distinct cellular compartments and
               signal transduction pathways. Cyclodepsipeptides, which are
               currently being evaluated in clinical trials, are used in
               refractory cancer therapy, usually in combination with other
               cytotoxic drugs. A series of cyclooctadepsipeptides, however,
               shows a completely different spectrum of biological activity,
               namely, potent anthelmintic properties. A number of
               cyclodepsipeptides have been well characterized in vitro and in
               vivo, and interesting modes of action, such as antiplasmodial,
               antiviral, insecticidal, cytotoxic, and antiproliferative
               properties have been observed. Whether these natural products
               will be of benefit for patients must be evaluated in clinical
               trials. Recently, a number of cyclodepsipeptides from marine
               sponges, bacteria and fungi have been identified. Subsequent
               structural determination revealed unique structural features
               within some of these compounds. It was suggested that the cyclic
               depsipeptide structure is important for the biological activity
               because the linear homologues were inactive. The scope of
               activity of these newly isolated natural products spans a range
               from cytoprotective activity against HIV-1 infection, growth
               inhibitory effects toward cancer cells, and antimycobacterial,

               nervous system. Ion channel targets have some obvious
               advantages. They tend to act quickly, which means that they will
               clear many infections rapidly. They produce very obvious effects
               on the worms, typically paralyzing them, and these effects are
               suitable for use in rapid and high-throughput assays. Many of
               the ion channels and enzymes targeted can also be incorporated
               into such assays. The macrocyclic lactones bind to an allosteric
               site on glutamate-gated chloride channels, either directly
               activating the channel or enhancing the effect of the normal
               agonist, glutamate. Many old and new anthelmintics, including
               tribendimidine and the amino-acetonitrile derivatives, act as
               agonists at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; derquantel is an
               antagonist at these receptors. Nematodes express many different
               types of nicotinic receptor and this diversity means that they
               are likely to remain important targets for the foreseeable
               future. Emodepside may have multiple effects, affecting both a
               potassium channel and a pre-synaptic G protein-coupled receptor;
               although few other current drugs act at such targets, this

               PF1022A are broad-spectrum nematicidal drugs which are able to
               eliminate nematodes resistant to other anthelmintics. The mode
               of action of cyclooctadepsipeptides is only partially
               understood, but involves the latrophilin Lat-1 receptor and the
               voltage- and calcium-activated potassium channel Slo-1. Genetic
               evidence suggests that emodepside exerts its anthelmintic
               activity predominantly through Slo-1. Indeed, slo-1 deficient
               Caenorhabditis elegans strains are completely emodepside
               resistant. However, direct effects of emodepside on Slo-1 have
               not been reported and these channels have only been
               characterized for C. elegans and related Strongylida. Molecular
               and bioinformatic analyses identified full-length Slo-1 cDNAs of

               ratti. Two paralogs were identified in the trichocephalids
               Trichuris muris, Trichuris suis and Trichinella spiralis.
               Several splice variants encoding truncated channels were
               identified in Trichuris spp. Slo-1 channels of trichocephalids
               form a monophyletic group, showing that duplication occurred
               after the divergence of Enoplea and Chromadorea. To explore the
               function of a representative protein, C. elegans Slo-1a was
               expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and studied in
               electrophysiological (voltage-clamp) experiments. Incubation of
               oocytes with 1-10 µM emodepside caused significantly increased
               currents over a wide range of step potentials in the absence of
               experimentally increased intracellular Ca2+, suggesting that
               emodepside directly opens C. elegans Slo-1a. Emodepside wash-out
               did not reverse the effect and the Slo-1 inhibitor verruculogen
               was only effective when applied before, but not after,
               emodepside. The identification of several splice variants and
               paralogs in some parasitic nematodes suggests that there are
               substantial differences in channel properties among species.
               Most importantly, this study showed for the first time that
               emodepside directly opens a Slo-1 channel, significantly

               neuromuscular junction is a significant determinant of this
               effect. Pharmacological and electrophysiological analyses in the
               parasitic nematode Ascaris suum have resolved that emodepside
               elicits a hyperpolarisation of body wall muscle, which is
               dependent on extracellular calcium and the efflux of potassium
               ions. The molecular basis for emodepside's action has been
               investigated in forward genetic screens in the free-living
               nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Two screens for emodepside
               resistance, totalling 20,000 genomes, identified several mutants
               of slo-1, which encodes a calcium-activated potassium channel
               homologous to mammalian BK channels. Slo-1 null mutants are more
               than 1000-fold less sensitive to emodepside than wild-type C.
               elegans and tissue-specific expression studies show emodepside
               acts on SLO-1 in neurons regulating feeding and motility as well
               as acting on SLO-1 in body wall muscle. These genetic data,
               combined with physiological measurements in C. elegans and the
               earlier physiological analyses on A. suum, define a pivotal role
               for SLO-1 in the mode of action of emodepside. Additional
               signalling pathways have emerged as determinants of emodepside's
               mode of action through biochemical and hypothesis-driven
               approaches. Mutant analyses of these pathways suggest a
               modulatory role for each of them in emodepside's mode of action;
               however, they impart much more modest changes in the sensitivity
               to emodepside than mutations in slo-1. Taken together these
               studies identify SLO-1 as the major determinant of emodepside's
               anthelmintic activity. Structural information on the BK channels
               has advanced significantly in the last 2 years. Therefore, we
               rationalise this possibility by suggesting a model that

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Anthelmintics are required for treatment
               and prophylaxis of nematode parasites of humans and domestic
               animals. Emodepside, a cyclooctadepsipeptide, is a modern
               anthelmintic that has a novel mode of action involving a
               Ca-activated K channel (SLO-1) in Caenorhabditis elegans,
               sometimes mediated by a latrophilin (LAT) receptor. We examined
               mechanisms of action of emodepside in a parasitic nematode,
               Ascaris suum. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: RT-PCR was used to
               investigate expression of slo-1 and lat-1 in A. suum muscle
               flaps, and two-micropipette current-clamp and voltage-clamp
               techniques were used to record electrophysiological effects of
               emodepside. KEY RESULTS: Expression of slo-1 and lat-1 were
               detected. Emodepside produced a slow time-dependent (20 min),
               4-aminopyridine sensitive, concentration-dependent
               hyperpolarization and increase in voltage-activated K currents.
               Sodium nitroprusside increased the hyperpolarizations and K
               currents. N-nitro-L-arginine inhibited the hyperpolarizations
               and K currents. Phorbol-12-myristate-13 acetate increased the K
               currents, while staurosporine inhibited the hyperpolarizations
               and K currents. Iberiotoxin reduced these emodepside K currents.
               The effect of emodepside was reduced in Ca-free solutions.
               Emodepside had no effect on voltage-activated Ca currents.
               CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Asu-slo-1 and Asu-lat-1 are
               expressed in adult A. suum muscle flaps and emodepside produces
               slow activation of voltage-activated Ca-dependent SLO-1-like K
               channels. The effect of emodepside was enhanced by stimulation
               of protein kinase C and NO pathways. The data are consistent
               with a model in which NO, PKC and emodepside signalling pathways
               are separate and converge on the K channels, or in which
               emodepside activates NO and PKC signalling pathways to increase
               opening of the K channels.",

               is an obvious lack of appropriately characterized experimental
               infection models. Therefore, a detailed parasitological
               characterization of a Trichuris muris isolate was performed in
               C57BL/10 mice. Subsequently, the in vivo efficacies of the
               aminophenylamidines amidantel, deacylated amidantel (dAMD) and
               tribendimidine as well as the cyclooctadepsipeptides emodepside
               and in particular PF1022A were analyzed. This was performed
               using various administration routes and treatment schemes
               targeting histotropic and further developed larval as well as
               immature and mature adult stages. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
               FINDINGS: Duration of prepatent period, time-dependent
               localization of larvae during period of prepatency as well as
               the duration of patency of the infection were determined before
               drugs were tested in the characterized trichurosis model.
               Amidantel showed no effect against mature adult T. muris.
               Tribendimidine showed significantly higher potency than dAMD
               after oral treatments (ED50 values of 6.5 vs. 15.1 mg/kg).
               However, the opposite was found for intraperitoneal treatments
               (ED50 values of 15.3 vs. 8.3 mg/kg). When emodepside and PF1022A
               were compared, the latter was significantly less effective
               against mature adults following intraperitoneal (ED50 values of
               6.1 vs. 55.7 mg/kg) or subcutaneous (ED50 values of 15.2 vs.
               225.7 mg/kg) administration. Only minimal differences were
               observed following oral administration (ED50 values of 2.7 vs.
               5.2 mg/kg). Triple and most single oral doses with moderate to
               high dosages of PF1022A showed complete efficacy against
               histotropic second stage larvae (3 $\times$ 100 mg/kg or 1
               $\times$ 250 mg/kg), further developed larvae (3 $\times$ 10
               mg/kg or 1 $\times$ 100 mg/kg) and immature adults (3 $\times$
               10 mg/kg or 1$\times$100 mg/kg). Histotropic first stage larvae
               were only eliminated after three doses of PF1022A (3 $\times$
               100 mg/kg) but not after a single dose.
               CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that the

               anthelmintic originally developed for animal health. These
               treatments are primarily directed against migrating
               microfilariae and also suppress fecundity for several months,
               but fail to eliminate adult O. volvulus. Therefore, elimination
               programs need time frames of decades, well exceeding the life
               span of adult worms. The situation is worsened by decreased
               ivermectin efficacy after long-term therapy. To improve
               treatment options against onchocerciasis, a drug development
               candidate should ideally kill or irreversibly sterilize adult
               worms. Emodepside is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic used for the
               treatment of parasitic nematodes in cats and dogs (Profender and
               Procox). Our current knowledge of the pharmacology of emodepside
               is the result of more than 2 decades of intensive collaborative
               research between academia and the pharmaceutical industry.
               Emodepside has a novel mode of action with a broad spectrum of
               activity, including against extraintestinal nematode stages such
               as migrating larvae or macrofilariae. Therefore, emodepside is
               considered to be among the most promising candidates for
               evaluation as an adulticide treatment against onchocerciasis.
               Consequently, in 2014, Bayer and the Drugs for Neglected
               Diseases initiative (DNDi) started a collaboration to develop
               emodepside for the treatment of patients suffering from the
               disease. Macrofilaricidal activity has been demonstrated in
               various models, including Onchocerca ochengi in cattle, the
               parasite most closely related to O. volvulus. Emodepside has now
               successfully passed Phase I clinical trials, and a Phase II
               study is planned. This Bayer--DNDi partnership is an outstanding
               example of ``One World Health,'' in which experience gained in

               anthelmintics have been discovered through screens using

               particularly useful for those in the same clade. In this context
               an important achievement has been the sequencing of the C.
               elegans genome followed by the genomes of a number of parasitic
               nematodes. This has enabled the identification of homologous and
               orthologous genes between C. elegans and parasitic nematodes
               with two particular experimental advances: (i) the
               identification of genes in C. elegans that are orthologous to
               those genes key for normal function in parasitic nematodes and
               (ii) the expression of parasitic nematode genes in C. elegans to
               facilitate their functional characterization. Examples of both
               will be given here. The value of the experimental tractability
               of C. elegans is weighed against the extent to which it provides
               a reliable indicator for gene function in parasitic nematodes.
               Also, we review the value of C. elegans in elucidating the mode
               of action of anthelmintics with particular reference to
               anthelmintics acting on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
               glutamate-gated chloride channels, and calcium-activated
               potassium channels. The examples highlight the use of C. elegans
               as a model system to identify anthelmintic drug targets.
               Finally, the potential impact of newer technologies encompassing
               microfluidics, optogenetics, and imaging on the utility of C.
               elegans for high-throughput anthelmintic drug discovery is

  abstract  = "'The best way to predict the future is to create it.' When we
               look at drugs that are used to control parasites, we see that
               new knowledge has been created (discovered) about their modes of
               action. This knowledge will allow us to predict combinations of
               drugs which can be used together rationally to increase the
               spectrum of action and to slow the development of anthelmintic
               resistance. In this paper we comment on some recent observations
               of ours on the modes of action of emodepside, diethylcarbamazine
               and tribendimidine. Emodepside increases the activation of a
               SLO-1 K(+) current inhibiting movement, and diethylcarbamazine
               has a synergistic effect on the effect of emodepside on the
               SLO-1 K(+) current, increasing the size of the response. The
               combination may be considered for further testing for
               therapeutic use. Tribendimidine is a selective cholinergic
               nematode B-subtype nAChR agonist, producing muscle
               depolarization and contraction. It has different subtype
               selectivity to levamisole and may be effective in the presence
               of some types of levamisole resistance. The new information
               about the modes of action may aid the design of rational drug

               present in species such as Dirofilaria immitis, which causes
               Heartworm disease in dogs. Furthermore, there is evidence of
               resistance to ivermectin in Onchocerca volvulus in humans, and
               the results of efficacy evaluations coupled with detection of
               resistance mutations in soil transmitted helminths raise the
               possibility that it may be developing in gastrointestinal
               nematodes of humans. The main anthelmintic classes, based on
               drug chemistry and drug receptors/modes of action, are the
               benzimidazoles (BZs), the macrocyclic lactones (MLs), and a
               variety of drugs that act on acetylcholine receptors (AChRs),
               such as levamisole and monepantel. Resistance has arisen in
               several nematode species to all of these drug classes. Our
               understanding of the mechanism(s) and genetics of resistance is
               most advanced with BZ resistance and involves single nucleotide
               variants (SNVs) in $\beta$-tubulin genes. These changes can be
               detected to monitor for BZ resistance. Resistance to MLs appears
               more complicated. However, recently SNVs in dyf-7 genes
               associated with resistance were found and a mechanism of
               resistance involving these genes and ABC transporters is
               hypothesized below. These advances may allow molecular
               monitoring for ML resistances in the near future. While genetic
               and protein changes that cause levamisole or monepantel
               resistance have been found, the situation appears quite complex
               with anthelmintics which act on AChR in nematodes and a simple
               panel of molecular markers for AChR anthelmintic resistances is

               elimination, a macrofilaricidal drug that kills the adult
               parasite is urgently needed. Emodepside has shown
               macrofilaricidal activity against a variety of nematodes and is
               currently under clinical development for the treatment of
               onchocerciasis. The aims of this study were i) to characterize
               the population pharmacokinetic properties of emodepside, ii) to
               link its exposure to adverse events in healthy volunteers, and
               iii) to propose an optimized dosing regimen for a planned phase
               II study in onchocerciasis patients. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL
               FINDINGS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and adverse event
               data were obtained from 142 subjects enrolled in three phase I
               studies, including a single-dose, and a multiple-dose,
               dose-escalation study as well as a relative bioavailability
               study. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to evaluate the
               population pharmacokinetic properties of emodepside. Logistic
               regression modeling was used to link exposure to drug-related
               treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Emodepside
               pharmacokinetics were well described by a transit-absorption
               model, followed by a 3-compartment disposition model. Body
               weight was included as an allometric function and both food and
               formulation had a significant impact on absorption rate and
               relative bioavailability. All drug-related TEAEs were transient,
               and mild or moderate in severity. An increase in peak plasma
               concentration was associated with an increase in the odds of
               experiencing a drug-related TEAE of interest.
               CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Pharmacokinetic modeling and
               simulation was used to derive an optimized, body weight-based
               dosing regimen, which allows for achievement of extended

               identify markers associated with one or more of the traits.
               Principal component analysis (PCA) is a useful tool that has
               been widely used for the multivariate analysis of correlated
               variables. PCA is usually applied as a dimension reduction
               method: the few top principal components (PCs) explaining most
               of total trait variance are tested for association with a
               predictor of interest, and the remaining components are not
               analyzed. In this study we review the theoretical basis of PCA
               and describe the behavior of PCA when testing for association
               between a SNP and correlated traits. We then use simulation to
               compare the power of various PCA-based strategies when analyzing
               up to 100 correlated traits. We show that contrary to widespread
               practice, testing only the top PCs often has low power, whereas
               combining signal across all PCs can have greater power. This
               power gain is primarily due to increased power to detect genetic
               variants with opposite effects on positively correlated traits
               and variants that are exclusively associated with a single
               trait. Relative to other methods, the combined-PC approach has
               close to optimal power in all scenarios considered while
               offering more flexibility and more robustness to potential
               confounders. Finally, we apply the proposed PCA strategy to the

               significance testing procedures using data from a commercial pig

               whole-genome sequence data, fitting a genomic relationship
               matrix based on a leave-one-chromosome-out approach to account
               for population structure. Subsequently, genomic inflation
               factors were assessed on whole-genome level and the chromosome
               level. To establish a significance threshold, permutation
               testing, Bonferroni corrections using either the total number of
               SNPs or the number of independent chromosome fragments, and
               false discovery rates (FDR) using either the Benjamini-Hochberg
               procedure or the Benjamini and Yekutieli procedure were

               differ between different density genotypes but do differ between
               chromosomes. Also, the leave-one-chromosome-out approach for
               GWAS or using the pedigree relationships did not account
               appropriately for population stratification and gave strong
               genomic inflation. Regarding different procedures for
               significance testing, when the aim is to find QTL regions that
               are associated with a trait of interest, we recommend applying
               the FDR following the Benjamini and Yekutieli approach to
               establish a significance threshold that is adjusted for multiple
               testing. When the aim is to pinpoint a specific mutation, the
               more conservative Bonferroni correction based on the total
               number of SNPs is more appropriate, till an appropriate method

              human and animal health globally. However, ivermectin resistance
              is widespread in veterinary helminths and there are growing
              concerns of sub-optimal responses to treatment in related
              helminths of humans. Despite decades of research, the genetic
              mechanisms underlying ivermectin resistance are poorly understood
              in parasitic helminths. This reflects significant uncertainty
              regarding the mode of action of ivermectin in parasitic
              helminths, and the genetic complexity of these organisms;
              parasitic helminths have large, rapidly evolving genomes and
              differences in evolutionary history and genetic background can
              confound comparisons between resistant and susceptible
              populations. We undertook a controlled genetic cross of a
              multi-drug resistant and a susceptible reference isolate of
              Haemonchus contortus, an economically important gastrointestinal
              nematode of sheep, and ivermectin-selected the F2 population for
              comparison with an untreated F2 control. RNA-seq analyses of male
              and female adults of all populations identified high
              transcriptomic differentiation between parental isolates, which
              was significantly reduced in the F2, allowing differences
              associated specifically with ivermectin resistance to be
              identified. In all resistant populations, there was constitutive
              upregulation of a single gene, HCON\_00155390:cky-1, a putative
              pharyngeal-expressed transcription factor, in a narrow locus on
              chromosome V previously shown to be under ivermectin selection.
              In addition, we detected sex-specific differences in gene
              expression between resistant and susceptible populations,
              including constitutive upregulation of a P-glycoprotein,
              HCON\_00162780:pgp-11, in resistant males only. After ivermectin
              selection, we identified differential expression of genes with
              roles in neuronal function and chloride homeostasis, which is
              consistent with an adaptive response to ivermectin-induced
              hyperpolarisation of neuromuscular cells. Overall, we show the
              utility of a genetic cross to identify differences in gene
              expression that are specific to ivermectin selection and provide
              a framework to better understand ivermectin resistance and

              health. Many of these exert their effects through modifying
              neural function underpinning behaviours essential for parasite
              viability. Selectivity against the parasite may be achieved
              through distinct pharmacological properties of the parasite
              nervous system, as exemplified by the success of the ivermectin
              which target a glutamate-gated chloride channel found only in
              invertebrates. Despite the success of the ivermectins, emerging
              resistance and concerns around eco-toxicity are driving the
              search for new nematocidal chemicals or drugs. Here, we describe
              the potential of a 5-HT-gated chloride channel MOD-1, which is
              involved in vital parasite behaviours with constrained
              distribution in the invertebrate phyla. This ion channel has
              potential pharmacophores that could be targeted by new
              nematocidal chemicals and drugs. We have developed a microtiter
              based bioassay for MOD-1 pharmacology based on its ectopic
              expression in the Caenorhabditis elegans essential neuron M4. We
              have termed this technology `PhaGeM4' for `Pharmacogenetic
              targeting of M4 neuron'. Exposure of transgenic worms harbouring
              ectopically expressed MOD-1 to 5-HT results in developmental
              arrest. By additional expression of a fluorescence marker in body
              wall muscle to monitor growth we demonstrate that this assay is
              suitable for the identification of receptor agonists and
              antagonists. Indeed, the developmental progression is a robustly
              quantifiable bioassay that resolves MOD-1 activation by
              quipazine, 5-carboxyamidotryptamine and fluoxetine and highlight
              methiothepin as a potent antagonist. This assay has the intrinsic
              ability to highlight compounds with optimal bioavailability and
              furthermore to filter out off-target effects. It can be extended
              to the investigation of other classes of membrane receptors and

              activity, which contrasts with transcription factor (TF) RNAi,
              which tends to repress promoter activity. We identify several TFs

              sound statistical quantification of important parameters, such as
              the level and significance of the increase in response and the
              range of concentration where it occurs, is strongly needed. Here,
              we present an improved statistical model to describe hormetic
              dose-response curves and test for the presence of hormesis. Using
              the delta method and freely available software, any percentage
              effect dose or concentration can be derived with its associated
              standard errors. Likewise, the maximal response can be extracted
              and the growth stimulation calculated. The new model was tested
              on macrophyte data from multiple-species experiments and on
              laboratory data of Lemna minor. For the 51 curves tested,
              significant hormesis was detected in 18 curves, and for another
              17 curves, the hormesis model described that data better than the
              logistic model did. The increase in response ranged from 5 to
              109\%. The growth stimulation occurred at an average dose
              somewhere between zero and concentrations corresponding to
              approximately 20 to 25\% of the median effective concentration
              (EC50). Testing the same data with the hormesis model proposed by
              Brain and Cousens in 1989, we found no significant hormesis.
              Consequently, the new model is shown to be far more robust than
              previous models, both in terms of variation in data and in terms
              of describing hormetic effects ranging from small effects of a

              causes intestinal disease in animals including humans. E.
              bieneusi is an obligate intracellular pathogen, typically causing
              severe or chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption and/or wasting.
              Currently, E. bieneusi is recognised as a fungus, although its
              exact classification remains contentious. The transmission of E.
              bieneusi can occur from person to person and/or animals to
              people. Transmission is usually via the faecal-oral route through
              E. bieneusi spore-contaminated water, environment or food, or
              direct contact with infected individuals. Enterocytozoon bieneusi
              genotypes are usually identified and classified by PCR-based
              sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of
              nuclear ribosomal DNA. To date, ~600 distinct genotypes of E.
              bieneusi have been recorded in ~170 species of animals, including
              various orders of mammals and reptiles as well as insects in >40

              recreational water, irrigation water, and treated raw- and
              waste-waters. Although many studies have been conducted on the

              parasitism of plants and animals has arisen at least 15 times

              that are proposed to be on the evolutionary trajectory to
              parasitism. Recent advances have permitted the determination of

              Nematoda, and identify possible genetic patterns associated with

              both the prevalence and magnitude of anthelmintic resistance, and
              this increase appears to be a worldwide phenomenon. Reports of
              anthelmintic resistance to multiple drugs in individual parasite
              species, and in multiple parasite species across virtually all
              livestock hosts, are increasingly common. In addition, since the
              introduction of ivermectin in 1981, no novel anthelmintic classes
              were developed and introduced for use in livestock until recently
              with the launch of monepantel in New Zealand. Thus, livestock
              producers are often left with few options for effective treatment
              against many important parasite species. While new anthelmintic
              classes with novel mechanisms of action could potentially solve
              this problem, new drugs are extremely expensive to develop, and
              can be expected to be more expensive than older drugs. Thus, it
              seems clear that the ``Global Worming'' approach that has taken
              hold over the past 40-50 years must change, and livestock
              producers must develop a new vision for parasite control and
              sustainability of production. Furthermore, parasitologists must
              improve methods for study design and data analysis that are used
              for diagnosing anthelmintic resistance, especially for the fecal
              egg count reduction test (FECRT). Currently, standards for
              diagnosis of anthelmintic resistance using FECRT exist only for
              sheep. Lack of standards in horses and cattle and arbitrarily
              defined cutoffs for defining resistance, combined with inadequate
              analysis of the data, mean that errors in assigning resistance
              status are common. Similarly, the lack of standards makes it
              difficult to compare data among different studies. This problem
              needs to be addressed, because as new drugs are introduced now

              pathogens worldwide and are extremely challenging to control. The
              recent completion of two root-knot nematode genomes opens the way
              for a comparative genomics approach to elucidate the success of
              these parasites. Sequencing revealed that Meloidogyne hapla, a
              diploid that reproduces by facultative, meiotic parthenogenesis,
              encodes approximately 14,200 genes in a compact, 54 Mpb genome.
              Indeed, this is the smallest metazoan genome completed to date.
              By contrast, the 86 Mbp Meloidogyne incognita genome encodes
              approximately 19,200 genes. This species reproduces by obligate
              mitotic parthenogenesis and exhibits a complex pattern of
              aneuploidy. The genome includes triplicated regions and contains
              allelic pairs with exceptionally high degrees of sequence
              divergence, presumably reflecting adaptations to the strictly
              asexual reproductive mode. Both root-knot nematode genomes have
              compacted gene families compared with the free-living nematode
              Caenorhabditis elegans, and both encode large suites of enzymes
              that uniquely target the host plant. Acquisition of these genes,
              apparently via horizontal gene transfer, and their subsequent
              expansion and diversification point to the evolutionary history
              of these parasites. It also suggests new routes to their control.",

              $\approx$6 million species. More emphasis has been placed on
              counts of free-living species than on parasitic species. We
              rectify this by quantifying the numbers and proportion of
              parasitic species. We estimate that there are between 75,000 and
              300,000 helminth species parasitizing the vertebrates. We have no
              credible way of estimating how many parasitic protozoa, fungi,
              bacteria, and viruses exist. We estimate that between 3\% and 5\%
              of parasitic helminths are threatened with extinction in the next
              50 to 100 years. Because patterns of parasite diversity do not
              clearly map onto patterns of host diversity, we can make very
              little prediction about geographical patterns of threat to
              parasites. If the threats reflect those experienced by avian
              hosts, then we expect climate change to be a major threat to the
              relatively small proportion of parasite diversity that lives in
              the polar and temperate regions, whereas habitat destruction will
              be the major threat to tropical parasite diversity. Recent
              studies of food webs suggest that $\approx$75\% of the links in
              food webs involve a parasitic species; these links are vital for
              regulation of host abundance and potentially for reducing the
              impact of toxic pollutants. This implies that parasite

              tropical disease (NTD), we are entering a new era of combating
              NTDs. However, the worldwide prospects of increased mass drug
              administration (MDA) treatments warrant caution on the
              development of anthelmintic resistance. In this review, we
              discuss the practical implications of MDA programs on the
              development of anthelmintic resistance in human soil-transmitted
              helminths (STH). RECENT FINDINGS: There is poor evidence of
              anthelmintic resistance in human STH. Moreover, there is
              presumptive evidence that the refugia in MDA programs to control
              human STH is currently large, suggesting that the development of
              anthelmintic resistance in STH will be slow or may not occur. It
              remains unclear whether the current MDA strategy to control STH
              will sufficiently delay or prevent the development of
              anthelmintic resistance. First, differences in efficacy across
              and within STH species, and seasonal transmission of STH have not
              yet been considered. Second, any surveillance system to monitor
              drug efficacy is lacking. Finally, there is still no agreed
              strategy on how to deal with anthelmintic resistance once it
              emerges. SUMMARY: Although anthelmintic resistance in human STH
              is currently of limited concern, various actions should be put in
              place for its delay and monitoring, and strategies should be
              developed in case anthelmintic resistance occurs.",

              strongyloidiasis alongside soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in
              their 2021--30 roadmap, which aspires to target Strongyloides
              stercoralis with preventive chemotherapy by use of ivermectin.
              Combination treatment with both albendazole, the primary drug
              used to treat STH, and ivermectin, would improve the efficiency
              of mass drug administration targeting both STH and S stercoralis.
              In this Personal View, we discuss the challenges and
              opportunities towards the development of an efficient control
              programme for strongyloidiasis, particularly if it is to run
              concurrently with STH control. We argue the need to define the
              prevalence threshold to implement preventive chemotherapy for S
              stercoralis, the target populations and optimal dosing schedules,
              and discuss the added benefits of a fixed-dose coformulation of
              ivermectin and albendazole. Implementation of an efficient
              control programme will require improvements to current
              diagnostics, and validation of new diagnostics, to target and
              monitor S stercoralis infections, and consideration of the
              challenges of multispecies diagnostics for S stercoralis and STH
              control. Finally, the evolution of ivermectin resistance
              represents a credible risk to control S stercoralis; we argue
              that genome-wide approaches, together with improved genome
              resources, are needed to characterise and prevent the emergence
              of resistance. Overcoming these challenges will help to reduce

              Caenorhabditis elegans can provide a platform for both the
              discovery of new bioactive compounds and target identification.
              We screened 14,100 small molecules for bioactivity in wild-type
              worms and identified 308 compounds that induce a variety of
              phenotypes. One compound that we named nemadipine-A induces
              marked defects in morphology and egg-laying. Nemadipine-A
              resembles a class of widely prescribed anti-hypertension drugs
              called the 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs) that antagonize the
              alpha1-subunit of L-type calcium channels. Through a genetic
              suppressor screen, we identified egl-19 as the sole candidate
              target of nemadipine-A, a conclusion that is supported by several
              additional lines of evidence. egl-19 encodes the only L-type
              calcium channel alpha1-subunit in the C. elegans genome. We show

              orthologous protein target. Conversely, FDA-approved DHPs fail to
              elicit robust phenotypes, making nemadipine-A a unique tool to
              screen for genetic interactions with this important class of

              using it to reveal redundancy among three calcium channels in the
              egg-laying circuit. Our study demonstrates that C. elegans

  abstract = "Different life cycle stages of Haemonchus contortus adapt to
              different ecosystems. This adaptation is accompanied by
              alterations in gene transcription and expression associated with
              the energy, amino acid, nitrogen, lipid and/or nucleic acid
              metabolism of the respective stages. For example, the aerobic
              metabolism of larvae depends on an efficient citric acid cycle,
              whereas the anaerobic metabolism of adults requires glycolysis,
              resulting in the production of volatile fatty acids, such as
              acetic acid and propionic acid. There are only few anthelmintics
              targeting nematode energy metabolism. In addition, H. contortus
              has reduced pathways for amino acid metabolism, polyamine
              metabolism and nitrogen excretion pathways. Moreover, nucleic
              acid metabolism comprising purine and pyrimidine salvage pathways
              as well as lipid metabolism are reduced. In addition, nematodes
              possess a particular composition of their cuticle. Energy
              production of adult worms is mainly linked to egg production and
              complex regulation of the neuromuscular system in both females
              and males. In this context, microtubules consisting of $\alpha$-
              and $\beta$-tubulin heterodimers play a crucial role in the
              presynaptic vesicle transport. Due to the significant distinction
              of its quarternary structure in nematodes in comparison to other
              organisms, $\beta$-tubulin was identified as a major target for
              benzimidazoles used for anthelmintic treatment. Concerning the
              function of the neuromuscular system, acetylcholine, a ligand of
              the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), is the major
              excitatory neurotransmitter in H. contortus. In contrast,
              glutamate-gated chloride channels, calcium- and voltage-dependent
              potassium channels as well as $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A
              and its receptors act as inhibitory neurotransmitters and thus
              opponents to nAChR. For example, the calcium- and
              voltage-dependent potassium channel SLO-1 is an important target
              of emodepside, which is involved in the sensitive regulation of
              activatory and inhibitory receptors of the nervous system. Most
              of the modern anthelmintics target these different neuromuscular
              receptors. The mechanisms of resistance to anthelmintics, either
              specific or non-specific, are associated with changes in the
              molecular targets of the drugs, changes in metabolism of the drug
              (inactivation, removal or prevention of its activation) and/or
              increased efflux systems. The biochemical and molecular analyses
              of key developmental, metabolic and structural process of H.
              contortus still require substantial efforts. The nAChR,
              glutamate-gated chloride channel and calcium- and
              voltage-dependent potassium channel SLO-1 have long been known as
              being essential for nematode survival. Therefore, future research
              should be intensified to fully resolve the three-dimensional
              structures of these receptors, as has already been started for
              glutamate-gated chloride channel. With this knowledge, it should
              be possible to design new anthelmintics, which possess improved
              binding capacities to corresponding receptors.",

              of its anthelmintic effect is the calcium-activated potassium
              channel SLO-1. SLO-1 belongs to a family of channels that are
              highly conserved across the animal phyla and regulate
              neurosecretion, hormone release, muscle contraction, and neuronal
              network excitability. To investigate the selective toxicity of
              emodepside, we performed transgenic experiments in which the
              nematode SLO-1 channel was swapped for a mammalian ortholog,
              human KCNMA1. Expression of either the human channel or
              Caenorhabditis elegans slo-1 from the native slo-1 promoter in a
              C. elegans slo-1 functional null mutant rescued behavioral
              deficits that otherwise resulted from loss of slo-1 signaling.
              However, worms expressing the human channel were 10- to 100-fold
              less sensitive to emodepside than those expressing the nematode

              serotonin-stimulated feeding by interfering with SLO-1 signaling
              in the nervous system. Here we show that ectopic overexpression

              to emodepside, consistent with a direct interaction of emodepside
              with the channel. Taken together, these data predict an
              emodepside-selective pharmacophore harbored by SLO-1. This has

              tetrahydropyrimidines/imidazothiazoles, and the macrocyclic
              lactones. In nematodes, there are five targets for the existing
              anthelmintics: the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor which is
              the target of tetrahydropyrimidines/imidazothiazoles and
              indirectly that of the acetylcholineesterase inhibitors; the GABA
              receptor which is the target of piperazine, the glutamate-gated
              chloride channel as the target of the macrocyclic lactones, and
              beta-tubulin as the target of prebenzimidazoles/benzimidazoles.
              All these anthelmintics are now in serious danger because of the
              worldwide spread of resistant nematodes in sheep, cattle, horses
              and pigs. The class of cyclooctadepsipeptides has entered the
              scene of anthelmintic research in the early 1990s. PF1022A, the
              first anthelmintically active member, is a natural compound from
              the fungus Mycelia sterilia that belongs to the microflora of the
              leaves of the Camellia japonica. PF1022A contains 4
              N-Methyl-L-leucines, 2 D-lactic acids and 2-D-phenyllactic acids
              arranged as a cyclic octadepsipeptide with an alternating
              L-D-L-configuration. Emodepside is a semisynthetic derivative of
              PF1022A with a morpholine ring at each of the two D-phenyllactic
              acids in para position. The anthelmintic activity is directed
              against gastrointestinal nematodes in chicken, mice, rats,
              meriones, dogs, cats, sheep, cattle and horses. Moreover,
              emodepside is active against Trichinella spiralis larvae in
              muscles, microfilariae and preadult filariae and Dictyocaulus
              viviparus. PF1022A and emodepside are fully effective against
              benzimidazole-, levamisole or ivermectin-resistant nematodes in
              sheep and cattle. In Ascaris suum both cyclooctadepsipeptides
              lead to paralysis indicating a neuropharmacological action of
              these compounds. Using a PF1022A-ligand immunoscreening of a cDNA
              library from Haemonchus contortus a cDNA clone of 3569 base pairs
              could be identified. This clone codes for a novel 110 kDa
              heptahelical transmembrane receptor, named HC110R. Database- and
              phylogenetic analysis reveals that this receptor is a homolog to
              B0457.1 from Caenorhabditis elegans and has significant
              similarity to latrophilins from human, cattle and rat. HC110R is
              located in the plasma membrane and in lysosomes and endosomes.
              Alpha-latrotoxin, the poison of the black widow spider, binds at
              a 54 kDa aminoterminal fragment of HC110R. After binding a
              Ca2+-influx into HEK293 cells is induced which can be blocked by
              EGTA, Cd2+ or nifedipin. PF1022A or emodepside also bind to this
              54 kDa aminoterminal region of HC110R and interact with the
              functional responses of alpha-latrotoxin. In C. elegans
              antibodies against the C-or N-terminus of HC110R bind to the
              B0457.1 protein located in the pharynx. Electrophysiological
              studies reveal that emodepside inhibits pharyngeal pumping of the
              nematodes in a concentration dependent way with an IC(50) value
              of about 4 nM. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that emodepside
              exerts its action on nematodes via a latrophilin-like receptor
              which might have an important regulatory function on pharyngeal
              pumping.",

              approach to demonstrate that this natural variation is explained
              by a methionine-to-glutamine substitution in topoisomerase II
              (TOP-2). The presence of a non-polar methionine at this residue
              increases hydrophobic interactions between TOP-2 and its poison

              implications for medicine and agriculture. The identification of
              the molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropy has the power to
              reveal previously unknown biological connections between
              seemingly unrelated traits. Additionally, the discovery of
              pleiotropic genes increases our understanding of both genetic and
              phenotypic complexity by characterizing novel gene functions.
              Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been used to identify
              several pleiotropic regions in many organisms. However, gene
              knockout studies are needed to eliminate the possibility of
              tightly linked, non-pleiotropic loci. Here, we use a panel of 296
              recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines of Caenorhabditis
              elegans and a high-throughput fitness assay to identify a single
              large-effect QTL on the center of chromosome V associated with

              Using deletion strains created by genome editing, we show that
              scb-1, which was previously implicated in response to bleomycin,
              also underlies responses to other double-strand DNA

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Parascaris univalens is a pathogenic parasite of
              foals and yearlings worldwide. In recent years, Parascaris spp.
              worms have developed resistance to several of the commonly used
              anthelmintics, though currently the mechanisms behind this
              development are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate
              the transcriptional responses in adult P. univalens worms after
              in vitro exposure to different concentrations of three
              anthelmintic drugs, focusing on drug targets and drug
              metabolising pathways. METHODS: Adult worms were collected from
              the intestines of two foals at slaughter. The foals were
              naturally infected and had never been treated with anthelmintics.
              Worms were incubated in cell culture media containing different
              concentrations of either ivermectin (10-9 M, 10-11 M, 10-13 M),
              pyrantel citrate (10-6 M, 10-8 M, 10-10 M), thiabendazole (10-5
              M, 10-7 M, 10-9 M) or without anthelmintics (control) at 37 °C
              for 24 h. After incubation, the viability of the worms was
              assessed and RNA extracted from the anterior region of 36 worms
              and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system. RESULTS: All
              worms were alive at the end of the incubation but showed varying
              degrees of viability depending on the drug and concentration
              used. Differential expression (Padj < 0.05 and log2 fold change
              $\geq$ 1 or $\leq$ - 1) analysis showed similarities and
              differences in the transcriptional response after exposure to the
              different drug classes. Candidate genes upregulated or
              downregulated in drug exposed worms include members of the phase
              I metabolic pathway short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase
              superfamily (SDR), flavin containing monooxygenase superfamily
              (FMO) and cytochrome P450-family (CYP), as well as members of the

              the anthelmintics used were found to be upregulated and

              from the GABA receptor subunit lgc-37, which was upregulated only
              in worms exposed to 10-9 M of ivermectin. CONCLUSIONS: To our
              knowledge, this is the first time the expression of lgc-37 and
              members of the FMO, SDR, MFS and SLC superfamilies have been

              technology to perform such experiments exists, downstream
              analysis remains challenging. Different tools exist in a variety
              of ecosystems, but they often do not scale to large data and are
              not integrated into a single coherent workflow. Moreover, the
              outcome of processing is very sensitive to a multitude of
              algorithmic parameters. Hence, parameter optimization is not only
              critical but also challenging. We present SLAW, a scalable and
              yet easy-to-use workflow for processing untargeted LC-MS data in
              metabolomics and lipidomics. The capabilities of SLAW include (1)
              state-of-the-art peak-picking algorithms, (2) a new automated

              optimization were designed for robust analysis of untargeted

              SLAW to two state-of-the-art workflows based on openMS and XCMS.
              SLAW was able to detect and align more reproducible features in
              all data sets considered. SLAW scaled well, and its analysis of a
              data set with 2500 LC-MS files consumed 40\% less memory and was
              6 times faster than that using the XCMS-based workflow. SLAW also
              extracted 2-fold more isotopic patterns and MS2 spectra, which in

              the limited selection of currently available matrix-matched RMs
              reduces their applicability for widespread use. To produce an RM
              in any context, for any matrix that is robust to changes over the
              course of time, we developed iterative batch averaging method
              (IBAT). To illustrate this method, we generated 11 independently
              grown Escherichia coli batches and made an RM over the course of
              10 IBAT iterations. We measured the variance of these materials
              by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and showed that IBAT produces
              a stable and sustainable RM over time. This E. coli RM was then
              used as a food source to produce a Caenorhabditis elegans RM for

              samples of the same genotype, allowed us to estimate the
              proportion of sample variation in preanalytical steps. From the
              NMR data, we found that 40\% of the metabolite variance is due to
              the metabolite extraction process and analysis and 60\% is due to
              sample-to-sample variance. The availability of RMs in untargeted
              metabolomics is one of the predominant needs of the metabolomics
              community that reach beyond quality control practices. IBAT

               In the 1940 and 1950s, dose-response analysis was intimately
               linked to evaluation of toxicity in terms of binary responses,
               such as immobility and mortality, with a limited number of doses
               of a toxic compound being compared to a control group (dose 0).
               Later, dose-response analysis has been extended to other types
               of data and to more complex experimental designs. Moreover,
               estimation of model parameters has undergone a dramatic change,
               from struggling with cumbersome manual operations and
               transformations with pen and paper to rapid calculations on any
               laptop. Advances in statistical software have fueled this
               development. Key Features: Provides a practical and
               comprehensive overview of dose-response analysis. Includes
               numerous real data examples to illustrate the methodology. R

               continuous, binomial, count, multinomial, and event-time
               dose-response data. The statistical models used are partly
               special cases, partly extensions of nonlinear regression models,
               generalized linear and nonlinear regression models, and
               nonlinear mixed-effects models (for hierarchical dose-response

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Albendazole (ABZ), a benzimidazole (BZ) anthelmintic
              (AH), is commonly used for treatment of soil-transmitted
              helminths (STHs). Its regular use increases the possibility that
              BZ resistance may develop, which, in veterinary nematodes is
              caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
              $\beta$-tubulin gene at positions 200, 167 or 198. The relative
              importance of these SNPs varies among the different parasitic
              nematodes of animals studied to date, and it is currently unknown
              whether any of these are influencing BZ efficacy against STHs in
              humans. We assessed ABZ efficacy and SNP frequencies before and
              after treatment of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and
              hookworm infections. METHODS: Studies were performed in Haiti,
              Kenya, and Panama. Stool samples were examined prior to ABZ
              treatment and two weeks (Haiti), one week (Kenya) and three weeks
              (Panama) after treatment to determine egg reduction rate (ERR).
              Eggs were genotyped and frequencies of each SNP assessed.
              FINDINGS: In T. trichiura, polymorphism was detected at codon
              200. Following treatment, there was a significant increase, from
              3.1\% to 55.3\%, of homozygous resistance-type in Haiti, and from
              51.3\% to 67.8\% in Kenya (ERRs were 49.7\% and 10.1\%,
              respectively). In A. lumbricoides, a SNP at position 167 was
              identified at high frequency, both before and after treatment,
              but ABZ efficacy remained high. In hookworms from Kenya we
              identified the resistance-associated SNP at position 200 at low
              frequency before and after treatment while ERR values indicated
              good drug efficacy. CONCLUSION: Albendazole was effective for A.
              lumbricoides and hookworms. However, ABZ exerts a selection
              pressure on the $\beta$-tubulin gene at position 200 in T.

              this parasite. In A. lumbricoides, the codon 167 polymorphism
              seemed not to affect drug efficacy whilst the polymorphism at
              codon 200 in hookworms was at such low frequency that conclusions
              cannot be drawn.",

              BZ-resistance associated $\beta$-tubulin gene single nucleotide
              polymorphisms. The overall CR was 69.9\% by Mini-FLOTAC and
              88.6\% by wet mount microscopy. The FECR was 75.4\% and the 95\%
              calculated confidence intervals were 50.4-87.8\% using sample

              BZ-resistance associated polymorphisms were found in the four
              Ascaris $\beta$-tubulin isotype genes examined. Since FECRs <95\%
              indicate reduced efficacy, these findings raise the suspicion of
              BZ resistance. In the absence of respective molecular evidence,
              heritable AR in the local Ascaris populations cannot be formally
              proven. However, since FECRs <95\% indicate reduced efficacy, BZ
              resistance may be suspected which would be alarming and calls for

              is the backbone of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) control
              programs. Over the past decade, drug coverage has increased and
              with it, the possibility of developing anthelmintic resistance.
              It is therefore of utmost importance to monitor drug efficacy.
              Currently, a variety of novel diagnostic methods are available,
              but it remains unclear whether they can be used to monitor drug
              efficacy. In this study, we compared the efficacy of albendazole
              (ALB) measured by different diagnostic methods in a head-to-head
              comparison to the recommended single Kato-Katz. METHODS: An ALB
              efficacy trial was performed in 3 different STH-endemic countries
              (Ethiopia, Lao PDR and Tanzania), each with a different
              PC-history. During these trials, stool samples were evaluated
              with Kato-Katz (single and duplicate), Mini-FLOTAC, FECPAKG2, and
              qPCR. The reduction rate in mean eggs per gram of stool (ERR) and
              mean genome equivalents / ml of DNA extract (GERR) were
              calculated to estimate drug efficacy. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS AND
              CONCLUSIONS: The results of the efficacy trials showed that none
              of the evaluated diagnostic methods could provide reduction rates
              that were equivalent to a single Kato-Katz for all STH. However,
              despite differences in clinical sensitivity and egg counts, they
              agreed in classifying efficacy according to World Health
              Organization (WHO) guidelines. This demonstrates that diagnostic
              methods for assessing drug efficacy should be validated with
              their intended-use in mind and that other factors like
              user-friendliness and costs will likely be important factors in
              driving the choice of diagnostics. In addition, ALB efficacy
              against STH infections was lower in sites with a longer history
              of PC. Yet, further research is needed to identify factors that
              contribute to this finding and to verify whether reduced efficacy
              can be associated with mutations in the $\beta$-tubulin gene that
              have previously been linked to anthelmintic resistance. TRIAL

  abstract = "The widespread use of the herbicides Atrazine (ATR) has been
              raised attention due to its ubiquitous occurrence in the
              environment. As an endocrine disruptor, ATR causes reproductive,
              immune, nervous system toxicity in biota. In this study, we aimed
              to investigate metabolic profile characteristics and potential
              metabolic biomarker that reflects specific damage in toxic effect
              after ATR exposure. Hence, a metabolomics study was performed to
              determine the significantly affected metabolites and the
              reproduction and locomotion of C. elegans were investigated.
              Mediation analysis was used to evaluate the mediating effect of
              metabolites on association between ATR exposure and toxic effect.
              ATR ($\geq$0.04 mg/L) caused the significant dose dependent
              reduction of brood size and locomotion behavior, however, the
              body length and width were significantly decreased only in 40
              mg/L group. These results suggesting that brood size, head
              thrashes and body bends are more sensitive indictor to assessment
              ATR toxicity in C. elegans. Meanwhile, metabolomics analysis
              revealed that ATR exposure can induce metabolic profiles
              significant alterations in C. elegans. We found that 9
              metabolites significantly increased and 18 metabolites
              significantly decreased, such as phosphatidylcholine, GMP,
              CDP-choline, neopterin etc. Those alteration of metabolites were
              mainly involved in the pathways: glycerophospholipid metabolism,
              glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, folate biosynthesis, glycine, serine
              and threoninemetabolism, pyrimidine and purine metabolism.
              Overall, these changes are signs of possible oxidative stress and
              ATP synthesis disruption modification. Mediation analysis showed
              a significant indirect effect of ATR exposure on brood size, via
              7,8-dihydroneopterin 2',3'-cyclic-p, and phosphatidylcholine
              might mediate association between ATR exposure and body bends,
              suggesting that 7,8-dihydroneopterin 2',3'-cyclic-p and
              phosphatidylcholine might be potentially specificity marker for
              brood size and body bend respectively. This preliminary analysis
              investigates metabolic characteristics in C. elegans after ATR
              exposure, helping to understand the pathways involved in the

              dose-response analysis across 23 environmental toxicants using
              eight C. elegans strains representative of species-wide genetic
              diversity. We observed substantial variation in EC10 estimates
              and slope parameter estimates of dose-response curves of
              different strains, demonstrating that genetic background is a
              significant driver of differential toxicant susceptibility. We
              also showed that, across all toxicants, at least one C. elegans
              strain exhibited a significantly different EC10 or slope estimate
              compared to the reference strain, N2 (PD1074), indicating that
              population-wide differences among strains are necessary to
              understand responses to toxicants. Moreover, we quantified the
              heritability of responses (phenotypic variance attributable to
              genetic differences between individuals) to each toxicant
              exposure and observed a correlation between the exposure closest
              to the species-agnostic EC10 estimate and the exposure that
              exhibited the most heritable response. At least 20\% of the
              variance in susceptibility to at least one exposure level of each
              compound was explained by genetic differences among the eight C.
              elegans strains. Taken together, these results provide robust
              evidence that heritable genetic variation explains differential
              susceptibility across an array of environmental pollutants and
              that genetically diverse C. elegans strains should be deployed to
              aid high-throughput toxicological screening efforts.",

               Seventy-nine subjects in 10 cohorts in the single ascending dose
               study and 24 subjects in 3 ascending-dose cohorts in the
               multiple ascending dose study were enrolled. Emodepside as LSF
               was administered orally as single 1-40-mg doses and for 10 days
               as 5 or 10 mg once daily and 10-mg twice daily doses,
               respectively. Pharmacokinetics and safety were assessed up to 21

               or 20 mg emodepside were tested in the single ascending dose
               study. RESULTS: Emodepside as LSF was rapidly absorbed under
               fasting conditions, with dose-proportional increase in plasma
               concentrations at doses from 1 to 40 mg. Terminal half-life was

               burden in billions of animals and plants worldwide. Large scale
               use of anthelmintics has driven the evolution of resistance in a
               number of species that infect livestock and companion animals,
               and there are growing concerns regarding the reduced efficacy in
               some human-infective helminths. Understanding the mechanisms by
               which resistance evolves is the focus of increasing interest;
               robust genetic analysis of helminths is challenging, and
               although many candidate genes have been proposed, the genetic
               basis of resistance remains poorly resolved. RESULTS: Here, we
               present a genome-wide analysis of two genetic crosses between
               ivermectin resistant and sensitive isolates of the parasitic
               nematode Haemonchus contortus, an economically important
               gastrointestinal parasite of small ruminants and a model for
               anthelmintic research. Whole genome sequencing of parental
               populations, and key stages throughout the crosses, identified
               extensive genomic diversity that differentiates populations, but
               after backcrossing and selection, a single genomic quantitative
               trait locus (QTL) localised on chromosome V was revealed to be
               associated with ivermectin resistance. This QTL was common
               between the two geographically and genetically divergent
               resistant populations and did not include any leading candidate
               genes, suggestive of a previously uncharacterised mechanism
               and/or driver of resistance. Despite limited resolution due to
               low recombination in this region, population genetic analyses
               and novel evolutionary models supported strong selection at this
               QTL, driven by at least partial dominance of the resistant
               allele, and that large resistance-associated haplotype blocks
               were enriched in response to selection. CONCLUSIONS: We have
               described the genetic architecture and mode of ivermectin
               selection, revealing a major genomic locus associated with
               ivermectin resistance, the most conclusive evidence to date in

              literature in this field and discuss the future directions in
              which these technologies may be applied. English-language studies

              reporting diagnostic characteristics of handheld and mobile phone
              microscopy devices as compared to field-established gold standard
              reference tests. Seventeen studies were included in the analysis.
              Findings included the high performance of the Newton Nm1
              microscope in the diagnosis of Plasmodium species, Schistosoma
              mansoni, and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), exhibiting

              review of qualitative research conducted to inform decision
              makers about community and drug distributor perceptions and
              experiences of mass drug administration campaigns for the
              elimination of lymphatic filariasis. We focused on questions
              related to acceptability of the mass drug administration
              campaigns within these groups and their thoughts around the
              feasibility of planning and carrying out the campaigns. METHODS:
              We carried out a systematic search in five databases to identify
              potential studies. We included studies that focused on community
              members and drug distributors and used qualitative methods for
              data collection and analysis. We conducted a thematic framework
              analysis using the Supporting the Use of Research Evidence
              framework. Due to time constraints, one author conducted the
              screening, extraction and data analysis. FINDINGS: Studies found
              that communities lack knowledge and information about lymphatic
              filariasis and the mass drug administration campaigns and that
              this can have an impact on how many community members choose to
              take medication. Health workers often had a good understanding
              that lymphatic filariasis was a problem in their setting, of its
              cause and mode of transmission and that hydrocele and
              elephantiasis had the same cause. However, this knowledge was not
              as prevalent amongst community drug distributors who often had
              misconceptions surrounding the topic. Furthermore, studies found
              that the length, timing, level of community and health system
              involvement, access to care for side effects, inadequate numbers
              of drug distributors and supervisors and motivation of drug
              distributors influenced participation in mass drug administration
              campaigns. Finally, the inadequate training of drug distributors
              could influence community trust in the mass drug administration
              program and the drug distributor themselves if there was a
              perception that the person was uninformed or not trained to carry
              out their tasks.",

               health problem for animals in different parts of the globe.
               Control of helminthiasis has largely relied on the use of
               pharmaceutical anthelmintics. Unfortunately, the exhaustive use
               of anthelmintic drugs has led to a serious and dramatic level of
               anthelmintic resistance. Anthelmintic resistance is a heritable
               loss of sensitivity of an anthelmintic in a parasite population
               that was in the past susceptible to the same anthelmintic. The
               development of anthelmintic resistance is evident to different
               helminths of almost every animal species and to different groups
               of anthelmintic in several continents. Frequent treatment,
               underdosing, genetics of the parasite, and targeting and timing
               of mass treatment are predisposing factors for anthelmintic
               resistance. Upregulation of cellular efflux mechanisms, an
               increase in drug metabolism, a change in drug receptor sites
               that reduces drug binding or the functional consequences of drug
               binding, and a decrease in drug receptor abundance through
               reduced expression within the parasite are the main mechanisms
               of anthelmintic resistance. In vivo method like fecal egg count
               reduction test and in vitro method such as egg hatch assays,
               larval motility test, larval development test and PCR can be
               used for the detection of anthelmintic resistance. Proper
               utilization of anthelmintic drugs, using combined anthelmintic
               and applying other alternatives are essential strategies to slow
               down the development of anthelmintic resistance. As anthelmintic
               resistance is a serious challenge throughout the world, proper
               utilization of the existing anthelmintics and reducing
               dependence on anthelmintics should be implemented to reduce its

               in Caenorhabditis elegans and the ruminant parasite Haemonchus

               in supernatants of C. elegans cultures with a hexose conjugate,
               most likely glucose, dominating for all five drugs. This work
               adds to a growing body of evidence that glucose conjugation is a
               major pathway of xenobiotic metabolism in nematodes and may be a
               target for enhancement of anthelmintic potency. Consistent with
               this, we found that biotransformation of albendazole by C.
               elegans reduced drug potency. Glucose metabolite production by
               C. elegans was reduced in the presence of the pharmacological
               inhibitor chrysin suggesting that UDP-glucuronosyl/glucosyl
               transferase (UGT) enzymes may catalyze benzimidazole
               glucosidation. Similar glucoside metabolites were detected
               following ex vivo culture of adult Haemonchus contortus. As a
               step towards identifying nematode enzymes potentially
               responsible for benzimidazole biotransformation, we
               characterised the transcriptomic response to each of the
               benzimidazole drugs using the C. elegans resistant strain CB3474
               ben-1(e1880)III. In the case of albendazole, mebendazole,
               thiabendazole, and oxfendazole the shared transcriptomic
               response was dominated by the up-regulation of classical
               xenobiotic response genes including a shared group of UGT
               enzymes (ugt-14/25/33/34/37/41/8/9). In the case of
               fenbendazole, a much greater number of genes were up-regulated,
               as well as developmental and brood size effects suggesting the
               presence of secondary drug targets in addition to BEN-1. The
               transcriptional xenobiotic response of a multiply resistant H.
               contortus strain UGA/2004 was essentially undetectable in the
               adult stage but present in the L3 infective stage, albeit more
               muted than C. elegans. This suggests that xenobiotic responses
               may be less efficient in stages of parasitic nematodes that
               reside in the host compared with the free-living stages.",

               Past work has often focused on pairs of interacting species, but
               observations of extant communities suggest that coevolution in
               nature occurs in networks of antagonism and mutualism. We
               discuss challenges for measuring coevolutionary dynamics in

              Summary Parasitic nematodes infect plants, animals, and humans,
              causing major health and economic burdens worldwide. Parasitic
              nematode infections are generally treated efficiently with a
              class of drugs named anthelmintics. However, resistance to many
              of these anthelmintic drugs, including macrocyclic lactones
              (MLs), is rampant and increasing. Therefore, it is essential that
              we understand how these drugs act against parasitic nematodes
              and, conversely, how nematodes gain resistance in order to better
              treat these infections in the future. Here, we used the
              non-parasitic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism
              to study ML resistance. We leveraged natural genetic variation
              between strains of C. elegans with differential responses to
              abamectin to identify three genomic regions on chromosome V, each
              containing one or more genes that contribute to ML resistance.
              Two of these loci have not been previously discovered and likely
              represent novel resistance mechanisms. We also compared the genes
              in these two novel loci to the genes found within genomic regions
              linked to ML resistance in the parasite Haemonchus contortus and
              found several cases of overlap between the two species. Overall,
              this study highlights the advantages of using C. elegans to
              understand anthelmintic resistance in parasitic nematodes.",

               subsequently at a more advanced stage than for other classes of

               benzimidazoles is likely to involve changes in the primary
               structure of beta-tubulins, the building blocks of microtubules.
               Specifically, point mutations in the beta-tubulin isotype 1 gene
               leading to amino acid substitutions in codons 167, 198, and 200

               of detecting the presence of resistance within populations. In
               this mini-review, we focus on the prevalence and importance of
               these polymorphisms in three groups of nematodes:
               trichostrongylids, cyathostomins, and hookworms. A brief

              infections is widespread, including resistance to benzimidazole
              (BZ) compounds commonly found in livestock parasites. Previous
              studies using the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to
              model parasitic nematode resistance have shown that
              loss-of-function mutations in the beta-tubulin gene ben-1 confer
              resistance to BZ drugs. However, the mechanism of resistance and
              the tissue-specific susceptibility are not well known in any
              nematode species. To identify in which tissue(s) ben-1 function
              underlies BZ susceptibility, transgenic strains that express
              ben-1 in different tissues, including hypodermis, muscles,
              neurons, intestine, and ubiquitous expression were generated.
              High-throughput fitness assays were performed to measure and
              compare the quantitative responses to BZ compounds among
              different transgenic lines. Significant BZ susceptibility was
              observed in animals expressing ben-1 in neurons, comparable to
              expression using the ben-1 promoter. This result suggests that
              ben-1 function in neurons underlies susceptibility to BZ.
              Subsetting neuronal expression of ben-1 based on neurotransmitter
              system further restricted ben-1 function in cholinergic neurons
              to cause BZ susceptibility. These results better inform our

              pests, and benzimidazoles are amongst the most important broad
              spectrum anthelmintic drug class used for their control.
              Benzimidazole resistance is now widespread in many species of
              parasitic nematodes in livestock globally and an emerging concern
              for the sustainable control of human soil transmitted helminths.
              $\beta$-tubulin is the major benzimidazole target, although other
              genes may influence resistance. Among the six C. elegans
              $\beta$-tubulin genes, loss of ben-1 causes resistance without
              other apparent defects. Here, we explored the genetics of C.
              elegans $\beta$-tubulin genes in relation to the response to the
              benzimidazole derivative albendazole. The most highly expressed
              $\beta$-tubulin isotypes, encoded by tbb-1 and tbb-2, were known
              to be redundant with each other for viability, and their products
              are predicted not to bind benzimidazoles. We found that tbb-2
              mutants, and to a lesser extent tbb-1 mutants, were
              hypersensitive to albendazole. The double mutant tbb-2 ben-1 is
              uncoordinated and dumpy, resembling the wild type exposed to
              albendazole, but the tbb-1 ben-1 double mutant did not show the
              same phenotype. These results suggest that tbb-2 is a modifier of
              ABZ sensitivity. To better understand how BEN-1 mutates to cause
              benzimidazole resistance, we isolated mutants resistant to
              albendazole and found that 15 of 16 mutations occurred in ben-1.
              Mutations ranged from likely nulls to hypomorphs, and several
              corresponded to residues that cause resistance in other
              organisms. Null alleles of ben-1 are albendazole-resistant and
              BEN-1 shows high sequence identity with tubulins from other
              organisms, suggesting that many amino acid changes could cause
              resistance. However, our results suggest that missense mutations
              conferring resistance are not evenly distributed across all
              possible conserved sites. Independent of their roles in
              benzimidazole resistance, tbb-1 and tbb-2 may have specialized
              functions as null mutants of tbb-1 or tbb-2 were cold or heat
              sensitive, respectively.",

              proliferative pathways vary within and among species. For
              example, genetic differences can accumulate within populations
              because xenobiotic exposures are not constant and selection is
              variable. Additionally, neutral genetic variation can accumulate
              in conserved proliferative pathway genes because these systems
              are robust to genetic perturbations given their essential roles

              the laboratory, sequence substitutions in ion-channels can
              contribute to macrocyclic lactone resistance, but there is little
              evidence that they are significant in the field. Changes in gene
              expression are associated with resistance to several different
              classes of anthelmintic. Increased P-glycoprotein expression may
              prevent drug access to its site of action. Decreased expression
              of ion-channel subunits and the loss of specific receptors may
              remove the drug target. Tools for the identification and genetic
              analysis of parasitic nematodes and a new online database will
              help to coordinate research efforts in this area. Resistance may
              result from a loss of sensitivity as well as the appearance of
              resistance. A focus on the presence of anthelmintic
              susceptibility may be as important as the detection of

               worms in the host can vary between animals even when
               administered doses are tailored to individual liveweight at the
               manufacturer's recommended rate. Factors contributing to

               Monte-Carlo simulation. A model framework was established where
               100 animals each received a single drug treatment. The `dose' of
               drug allocated to each animal (i.e. the concentration-time
               profile of drug reaching the target worms) was sampled at random
               from a distribution of doses with mean m and standard deviation
               s. For each animal the dose of drug was used in conjunction with
               pre-determined dose-response relationships, representing single
               and poly-genetic inheritance, to calculate efficacy against
               susceptible and resistant genotypes. These data were then used
               to calculate the overall change in resistance gene frequency for
               the worm population as a result of the treatment. Values for m
               and s were varied to reflect differences in both mean dose and
               the variability in dose, and for each combination of these
               100,000 simulations were run. The resistance gene frequency in
               the population after treatment increased as m decreased and as s
               increased. This occurred for both single and poly-gene models
               and for different levels of dominance (survival under treatment)
               of the heterozygote genotype(s). The results indicate that

              chemotherapeutic strategies. Similarly, as one reduces dosage

               established a practical, cost-effective and semi-automated high
               throughput screening (HTS) assay, which relies on the
               measurement of motility of larvae of the barber's pole worm
               (Haemonchus contortus) using infrared light-interference. Using
               this assay, we screened 80,500 small molecules and achieved a
               hit rate of 0.05\%. We identified three small molecules that

               Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful model system to study

               wild populations of the non-parasitic nematode C. elegans, three
               novel amino acid substitutions and a deletion in the
               $\beta$-tubulin drug target have been identified that confer
               varying levels of benzimidazole resistance. These residues are

               long-range mate-pairs and split-read alignments to accurately
               delineate genomic rearrangements at single-nucleotide

               rearrangements such as inversions or reciprocal translocations.
               DELLY, thus, enables to ascertain the full spectrum of genomic

              abundances of both known metabolites and those that have not to
              our knowledge been previously described. The latter metabolites
              include conjugates between 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) and several
              amino acids (3HP-AAs), which are much higher in abundance in one

              nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, simultaneous mutation of three
              genes, avr-14, avr-15, and glc-1, encoding glutamate-gated

              We propose a model in which ivermectin sensitivity in C. elegans

              by the family of GluCl genes. The sensitivity of these pathways

              livestock and crop plants. Control of these parasites is almost
              exclusively dependent on a small group of anthelmintic drugs, the
              most important of which belong to the macrocyclic lactone class.
              The extensive use of these drugs to control the ubiquitous
              trichostrongylid parasites of grazing livestock has resulted in
              the emergence of both single and multi-drug resistance. The
              expectation is that this resistance will eventually occur in the
              human parasites such as the common and debilitating soil
              transmitted nematodes and vector-borne filarial nematodes. While
              the modes of action of anthelmintics such as ivermectin, have
              been elucidated, notably in the model nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans, the molecular nature of this resistance remains to be
              fully determined. Here we show that the anterior amphids play a
              key role in ivermectin uptake and mutations in these sensory
              structures result in ivermectin resistance in C. elegans. Random
              genetic mutant screens, detailed analysis of existing amphid
              mutants and lipophilic dye uptake indicate that the non-motile
              ciliated amphid neurons are a major route of ivermectin ingress;
              the majority of the mutants characterised in this study are
              predicted to be involved in intraflagellar transport. In addition
              to a role in ivermectin resistance, a subset of the amphid
              mutants are resistant to the non-related benzimidazole class of
              anthelmintics, raising the potential link to a multi-drug

               intriguing. The ability to parasitize plants has originated
               independently at least three times during nematode evolution
               and, as more molecular data has emerged, it has become clear
               that multiple instances of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from
               bacteria and fungi have played a crucial role in the nematode's
               adaptation to this new lifestyle. The first reported HGT cases
               in plant-parasitic nematodes were genes encoding plant cell
               wall-degrading enzymes. Other putative examples of HGT were
               subsequently described, including genes that may be involved in
               the modulation of the plant's defense system, the establishment
               of a nematode feeding site, and the synthesis or processing of
               nutrients. Although, in many cases, it is difficult to pinpoint

  abstract  = "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) implies the non-sexual exchange
               of genetic material between species - in some cases even across
               kingdoms. Although common among Bacteria and Archaea, HGTs from
               pro- to eukaryotes and between eukaryotes were thought to be
               extremely rare. Recent studies on intracellular bacteria and
               their hosts seriously question this view. Recipient organisms
               could benefit from HGT as new gene packages could allow them to
               broaden or change their diet, colonize new habitats, or survive
               conditions that previously would have been lethal.About a decade
               ago, plant parasitic nematodes were shown to produce and secrete
               cellulases. Prior to this, animals were thought to fully depend
               on microbial symbionts for the breakdown of plant cell walls.
               This discovery prompted Keen and Roberts (1) to hypothesize that
               the ability of nematodes to parasitize plants was acquired by
               HGT from soil bacteria to (ancestral) bacterivorous nematodes.
               Since the identification of the first nematode cellulases, many
               more plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDE) have been
               identified in a range of plant parasitic nematode species.Here
               we discuss a number of criteria that can be used to underpin an
               HGT claim. HGT requires close physical contact between donor and
               recipient, and this could be achieved in, for example, a
               symbiont-host, or a trophic relationship. The former type of
               relationship was indeed shown to potentially result in the
               transfer of genetic material (e.g., Brugia malayi and
               Wolbachia). However, currently known endosymbionts of nematodes
               may not be the source of CWDEs. Remarkably, all cellulases
               discovered so far within the order Tylenchida belong to a single
               glycoside hydrolase family (GHF5). A range of soil bacteria
               harbours GHF5 cellulases, but of course nothing can be said
               about the gene content of soil bacteria at the time HGT took
               place (if at all). We suggest that characterisation of
               cellulases (and other CWDEs) and their genomic organisation in
               more basal (facultative) plant parasitic Tylenchida is needed to
               find out if CWDEs were indeed acquired via HGT from bacteria. A
               more complete picture about the evolution of CWDEs among plant
               parasitic Tylenchida will require a detailed characterisation of
               two - so far - fully unexplored basal suborders, Tylenchina and
               Criconematina. Finally, we performed a computational
               high-throughput identification of potential HGT candidates
               (including ones unrelated to CWDEs) in plant parasitic nematodes

               organisms, such genetic fixation can occur only in the germ

               vertebrates, without any apparent occurrence in evolutionary
               intermediates, that is, non-vertebrate eukaryotes. Phylogenetic

  abstract  = "Anthelmintic resistance is an accompaniment to modern livestock
               industry, which heavily relies on chemotherapy and
               chemoprophylaxis for maintaining animal health and productivity.
               While anthelmintic resistance is already established in horses
               and is a growing issue in cattle, it is, by far, the most severe
               and most prevalent in the sheep industry. To combat the spread
               of resistance, researchers are investigating alternative ways of
               nematode control and formulate recommendations to move towards
               more sustainable patterns of chemotherapeutic control. A further
               pillar in the management of nematodes is the understanding of
               the mechanisms underlying anthelmintic resistance. This
               knowledge is necessary to implement resistance diagnosis tests
               and might offer potential new drug targets. Macrocyclic lactones
               (MLs) and benzimidazoles (BZs) are the most frequently used
               anthelmintics in the sheep industry and resistance against them
               has been reported worldwide. Target-site related mechanisms
               usually are investigated first. For BZs, mutations in the
               {\ss}-tubulin isotype 1 gene leading to amino acid changes at
               the drug target site have been found to confer resistance in
               trichostrongyloid nematodes, which are among the most pathogenic
               parasites of small ruminants. These mutations have been
               exploited to set up several tests capable of diagnosing BZ
               resistance even at very low frequencies of resistance alleles in
               nematode populations. So far, no target-site related mechanisms
               have been identified in case of MLs and diagnosis of ML
               resistance is limited to in vivo and in vitro tests. Drug efflux
               by P-glycoproteins is a non-target-site related mechanism that
               has been proposed to play a role in ML resistance particularly.
               A third possibility that has come to receive more attention in
               recent years is bioinactivation of MLs and BZs by cytochrome
               P450 monooxygenases (CYPs). In cancer drug resistance research
               as well as in the field of insecticide and acaricide resistance
               CYPs and their contribution to drug resistance are well
               established concepts. Reasons to assume that CYPs might also be
               involved in anthelmintic resistance include, for instance, the
               metabolism of thiabendazole, a BZ representative, by CYP35D1 in
               the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the
               detection of BZ metabolites, consistent with CYP activity in the
               parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus. Despite these and many
               other indications, the role of CYPs in anthelmintic resistance
               is not fully clear. The present cumulative doctoral thesis
               elaborates on the likelihood of an involvement of CYPs in ML
               metabolism in C. elegans and BZ metabolism in H. contortus. The
               first part was primarily processed by an in vitro approach
               whereby the larval development of mutant strains was compared to
               that of the wild-type N2 strain under different ML exposures. In
               particular, a strain with a temperature-sensitive mutation in
               the cytochrome reductase gene emb-8 was compared at a
               non-permissive temperature to the wild-type regarding ivermectin
               (IVM) and moxidectin (MOX) susceptibility. The second part
               focused on expression patterns of CYPs in in vitro cultured
               fourth larvae of H. contortus. Here, constitutive and
               TBZ-inducible expression was investigated in five different H.
               contortus isolates with varying levels of phenotypic BZ
               resistance. Essentially, the ablation of CYP enzymatic activity
               by use of an inhibitor and a genetic approach was found to
               minimally alter the susceptibility to IVM in C. elegans, but not
               to MOX, both of which are MLs but belong to different groups.
               CYP14-A5, initially suspected to be involved in ML resistance in
               C. elegans, is most likely not involved, as its loss of activity
               was not shown to modulate IVM susceptibility and inducibility of
               gene expression by IVM or MOX was not observed. Therefore, CYPs
               can be expected to play no major role in ML resistance in C.
               elegans. As for BZ resistance in H. contortus, exposure to TBZ
               did not induce expression of selected CYPs in any of the
               isolates. However, the highly resistant WR isolate showed a 2.4-
               3.7- fold higher constitutive expression of CYP HCOI100383400 in
               comparison to BZ susceptible isolates. In a previously published
               study, this CYP has been shown to have elevated transcript
               levels in the gut -- the hypothesized major site of
               detoxification in nematodes. This is a first hint towards a
               possible involvement of CYPs in BZ resistance in a parasitic
               nematode. The WR isolate was also shown to be considerably more
               resistant than known resistant field isolates while having
               similar frequencies of the F200Y single nucleotide polymorphism
               (SNP) in the $\beta$-tubulin isotype 1 gene which along with
               E198A and F167Y is the primary cause for BZ resistance. The
               comparison of the frequency of F200Y and phenotypic resistance
               levels corroborates the long-held assumption of a multi-genic
               context for BZ resistance. Whether a co-governance of BZ
               resistance by several mechanisms in general and by the
               involvement of CYPs in particular is true, cannot be guaranteed
               with absolute certainty at the present state of research.
               However, the possibility of such should not be thoughtlessly
               abandoned, particularly in case of high resistance phenotypes as
               suggested by the present thesis. There is no question that
               further experimental investigations are necessary to improve our
               understanding of metabolism-based detoxification in nematodes.",

  abstract  = "Control of veterinary and human parasitic nematodes relies
               heavily on chemotherapy with anthelmintics but drug resistance
               is a growing problem. Against the widely used macrocyclic
               lactones (MLs), drug resistance has emerged in several nematode
               species and this is a particular challenge in parasites of
               ruminants and horses. For instance, ML resistance is globally
               widespread in an important pathogen of foals, Parascaris
               univalens. In order to find a sustainable solution for this
               problematic trend, several strategies have been proposed with
               the aim of maintaining susceptibility or reversing resistance.
               These strategies focus on optimized treatment and hygiene
               regimens guided and complemented by reliable resistance
               diagnosis and improved farm management. For their
               implementation, a good knowledge of the underlying resistance
               mechanisms is considered imperative. However, the underlying
               mechanisms of ML resistance are mostly unknown. In the last
               decade, considerable efforts have helped to functionally
               validate several candidate genes and to better understand some
               aspects of the genetic basis of ML resistance at the genomic and
               transcriptomic level. Although uncertainty remains, the
               ATP-binding-cassette (ABC)-transporters and particularly members
               of the ABCB subfamily, the P-glycoproteins (Pgps), have been
               proposed as contributors to ML resistance in several nematode
               species. The Pgp gene family in nematodes contains several
               different orthologous lineages but which Pgp genes play a role
               in ML resistance and how, is unknown.In a first step, the
               complete Pgp repertoire in the horse roundworm P. univalens was
               characterized by transcriptome-guided RT-PCR and Sanger
               sequencing. This allowed a considerable improvement of the
               annotation of a total of ten identified Pgp genes including an
               ascarid specific lineage and two gene duplications with
               subsequent divergence. Overall, this is a similarly sized
               repertoire compared to other nematodes, but the phylogenetic
               analysis revealed that the repertoire of Pgp lineages varies
               considerably between species. Using a diverse set of
               transcriptome resources, the tissue expression patterns of all
               P. univalens Pgp genes were characterized in P. univalens and in
               the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In both species,
               expression of Pgps was predominant in the intestine, moderate in
               the epidermis or carcass tissue (in P. univalens, containing the
               epidermis, neurons, muscles and the pharynx) and low in the
               gonads. No indicibility of individual P. univalens Pgp
               expression was found by examining a novel transcriptome
               generated from adult P. univalens incubated with ivermectin
               (IVM, a commonly used ML and an avermectin) or a control. Taken
               together, the two examined independent P. univalens
               transcriptome data sets showed that PunPgp-9 and PunPgp-11.1
               were the most strongly expressed genes followed by PunPgp-16.1
               and -2. These analyses provide a basis for future studies with a
               focus on selected candidate Pgps.To investigate the function of
               Pgps in nematodes and to examine which anthelmintics fall into
               the substrate range of Pgps, heterologous expression of P.
               univalens Pgps in different model organisms was employed. Two
               selected and phylogenetically distant P. univalens Pgps,
               PunPgp-9 and PunPgp-2, were examined for their ability to
               transport IVM, an ML, or thiabendazole, a benzimidazole, which
               is both an antimycotic and anthelmintic, by heterologous
               expression in an ABC-transporter deletion Saccharomyces
               cerevisiae strain. The results of this previously established
               assay, indicated that IVM, but not thiabendazole, is a conserved
               substrate of both examined Pgps. Alternate abstract:Die
               Strategie zur erfolgreichen Bek{\"a}mpfung von Infektionen mit
               parasitischen Nematoden beruht haupts{\"a}chlich auf
               chemotherapeutischer Intervention mit Anthelmintika, doch die
               Verbreitung von Resistenzen bereitet ein zunehmendes Problem.
               Gegen die h{\"a}ufig eingesetzten makrozyklischen Lactone (MLs)
               bestehen Resistenzen bereits in einer Reihe von parasitischen
               Nematoden und insbesondere bei Parasiten von Pferden und
               Wiederk{\"a}uern ist diese Entwicklung eine Herausforderung. Die
               ML Resistenz im pathogenen Pferdespulwurm Parascaris univalens
               beispielsweise, ist global weit verbreitet. Die aktuellen
               Empfehlungen f{\"u}r eine nachhaltige Parasitenbek{\"a}mpfung
               bauen daher auf optimierte und gezielte Behandlungsund
               Desinfektionsstratgien, welche durch verbesserte
               Diagnosestellung und nachhaltiges Betriebsmanagement geleitet
               werden. Ein gutes Verst{\"a}ndnis der zugrundeliegenden
               Resistenzmechanismen ist f{\"u}r die Umsetzung dieser Strategien
               unabdingbar, jedoch sind die ML Resistenzmechanismen immer noch
               weitgehend unbekannt. In den letzten Jahren konnten allerdings
               auf funktionaler, genomischer und transkriptomischer Ebene
               wesentliche neue Erkenntnisse gewonnen werden. Dabei zeigte
               sich, dass insbesondere die P-glycoproteine (Pgps) m{\"o}gliche
               Kandidatengene f{\"u}r die ML Resistenz darstellen. Diese zur
               Subfamilie B geh{\"o}renden ATP-binding-cassette
               (ABC)-Transporter bilden bei Nematoden eine Genfamilie mit
               verschiedenen orthologen Linien, doch welche Pgps f{\"u}r die ML
               Resistenz relevant sind und wie diese Transporter zur Resistenz
               beitragen, ist unklar.In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde durch
               Transkriptom-geleitete RT-PCR und SangerSequenzierung das
               gesamte Pgp-Repertoire des Pferdespulwurms P. univalens
               charakterisiert und entschl{\"u}sselt. Dabei wurde die
               genomische Annotation der zehn identifizierten Pgps erhebliche
               gegen{\"u}ber der urspr{\"u}nglichen automatischen Annotation
               verbessert. Damit ist die Anzahl von Pgp Genen {\"a}hnlich wie
               bei anderen Nematoden. Die phylogenetische Analyse zeigte aber
               auch, dass die Zusammensetzung der Pgp Gene zwischen den
               Nematodenspezies voneinander abweicht. Auf Basis verf{\"u}gbarer
               Transkriptomdaten wurden die Gwebeexpressionsprofile der
               einzelnen Pgps in dem Modellnematoden Caenorhabditis elegans
               vergleichend untersucht. Dabei wurde eine starke Expression im
               Darm, eine moderate Expression in der Epidermis bzw. im
               Hautmuskelschlauch (in P. univalens) und eine niedrige
               Expression in den Gonaden in beiden Spezies festgestellt. Anhand
               eines neuen Transkriptomdatensatzes, welche durch die Inkubation
               adulter W{\"u}rmer mit Ivermectin (IVM, ein gebr{\"a}uchliches
               ML aus der Gruppe der Avermectine) oder einer Kontrolle
               generiert wurde, konnte keine Induzierbarkeit der Expression
               einzelner Pgps festgestellt werden. In den zwei zuvor genannten
               und unabh{\"a}ngig generierten Transkriptomdatens{\"a}tzen taten
               sich PunPgp-9 und PunPgp-11.1 als die am st{\"a}rksten
               exprimierten Pgps hervor, sowie in einem geringeren Ausma{\ss}
               zwei PunPgp-16 Paraloge. Diese Ergebnisse bilden eine Basis
               f{\"u}r zuk{\"u}nftige Studien und erlauben eine gezielte
               Auswahl von Pgps f{\"u}r weitere Analysen.Um das
               Substratspektrum und die Funktion nematodischer Pgps n{\"a}her
               zu untersuchen, wurden P. univalens Pgps in verschiedenen
               Modellorganismen heterolog exprimiert. Zwei phylogenetisch
               entfernte P. univalens Pgps, PunPgp-2 und PunPgp-9, wurde durch
               die heterologe Expression in einem Saccharomyces cerevisiae
               Stamm mit ABC-TransporterDeletionen untersucht. Die Ergebnisse
               des bereits zuvor etablierten Hefewachstumsassay deuten darauf
               hin, dass IVM, jedoch nicht Thiabendazole (ein Antimykotikum und
               Anthelmintikum aus der Gruppe der Benzimidazole), als Substrat
               beider untersuchter Pgps konserviert ist.Die im ersten
               Projektabschnitt und auch in anderen Studien beobachtete starke
               Expression im Darm und moderate Expression in der Epidermis
               f{\"u}hrten zu der Hypothese, dass Pgps eine Rolle in der
               Barrierefunktion gegen{\"u}ber MLs spielen. Da die
               Penetrationsroute der MLs in den Wurm nicht bekannt ist, wurde
               ebenfalls der Effekt aktiver oraler Ingestion durch die
               Stimulierung pharyngealen Pumpens (PP) untersucht.",

               aging and disease. The worm has traditionally been used to
               explore gene function. Notably, one of the first genes shown to
               extend lifespan was discovered in C. elegans and was found to be
               conserved in humans. In the past ten years, though, it has been
               shown that this nematode utilizes a diverse class of small
               molecules called ascarosides that affect a variety of biological
               phenomena including development, aging, and mating. Yet many
               aspects of ascaroside biosynthesis and function remain
               incomplete. A second class of steroidal small molecules, the
               dafachronic acids, has also been recently discovered to be
               endogenous regulators of C. elegans physiology. It is clear that
               C. elegans is becoming established as a model for chemists. The
               work presented here highlights recent progress in our
               understanding of small molecule signaling in C. elegans. My
               Ph.D. research has contributed novel discoveries in the areas of
               sex-specific ascaroside biosynthesis, ascaroside modulation of
               lifespan, and ascaroside based immune system activation. My

               identifying their chemical structures are lacking. Recent
               studies revealed that a family of glycosides, the ascarosides,
               differentially regulate C. elegans development and behavior. Low
               concentrations of ascarosides attract males and thus appear to
               be part of the C. elegans sex pheromone, whereas higher
               concentrations induce developmental arrest at the dauer stage,
               an alternative, nonaging larval stage. The ascarosides act
               synergistically, which presented challenges for their
               identification via traditional activity-guided fractionation. As
               a result the chemical characterization of the dauer and male
               attracting pheromones remained incomplete. Here, we describe the
               identification of several additional pheromone components by
               using a recently developed NMR-spectroscopic approach,
               differential analysis by 2D NMR spectroscopy (DANS), which
               simplifies linking small molecule metabolites with their
               biological function. DANS-based comparison of wild-type C.
               elegans and a signaling-deficient mutant, daf-22, enabled
               identification of 3 known and 4 previously undescribed
               ascarosides, including a compound that features a p-aminobenzoic
               acid subunit. Biological testing of synthetic samples of these
               compounds revealed additional evidence for synergy and provided
               insights into structure-activity relationships. Using a
               combination of the three most active ascarosides allowed full
               reconstitution of the male-attracting activity of wild-type
               pheromone extract. Our results highlight the efficacy of DANS as
               a method for identifying small-molecule metabolites and placing
               them within a specific genetic context. This study further
               supports the hypothesis that ascarosides represent a

              treatment with monepantel, fecal egg counts failed to drop. This
              was accompanied by lambs mortality due to Haemonchus contortus
              infection. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of
              monepantel to control gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) in two
              sheep farms, in Uruguay. FINDINGS: A Fecal Egg Count Reduction
              Test (FECRT) was subsequently performed at the Experimental
              Stations Glencoe of INIA Tacuaremb{\'o} (Farm 1) and Sheep Unit
              of INIA La Estanzuela (Farm 2) using the World Association for
              the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology guidelines. On Farm 1
              the FECRT was performed using 6-8 month old Corriedale or Merino
              Dohne x Corriedale male lambs naturally infected with GIN. On day
              0 pre-treatment, three groups of 15 lambs each were selected,
              blocked by fecal egg count level (FEC) and randomly assigned to
              one of the following: Group 0 = untreated control, Group 1 =
              treated with monepantel (Zolvix\textregistered{}, Novartis Animal
              Health Inc.) from stock previously purchased; Group 2 = treated
              with monepantel from stock provided by the supplier, at the
              recommended dose of 2.5 mg/kg of body weight. Fecal samples were
              collected directly from the rectum from each lamb on day 0 and on
              day 9 post-treatment. On Farm 2, the FECRT was conducted on a
              group of 8 month old male lambs Milchschaff x Finn. At this farm,
              10 lambs were randomly allocated to be treated with monepantel
              (Group 1) and 10 lambs were randomly allocated to remain as
              untreated control (Group 0) using the same protocols as Farm 1.
              On farm 1 the FECR was 0.0\% (95\% CI = 0.0-49.0) and 42.0\%
              (95\% CI = 0.0-75.0) for Group 1 and Group 2 respectively. For
              Farm 2, the FECR was 82.1\% (95\% CI = 36.0-99.0). Haemonchus spp
              was the resistant genus. CONCLUSIONS: Poor effcicacy of

               aegagrus hircus, eight males and eight females) and 8 sheep
               (Ovis aries, four males and four females) 12-16 months old and
               weighing 20-32 kg, were used. The study was designed according

               were assigned as Group I and 16 goats were allocated into two
               groups (Group II and Group III). ABZ-SO was applied to Group I
               (sheep) and Group II (goats) animals subcutaneously, and to
               Group III (goats) animals intravenously, all at a dose rate of 5
               mg/kg BW. In Phase-2, the sheep in the Group I received ABZ-SO
               intravenously in a dose of 5 mg/kg BW; the goats in Group II and
               Group III received ABZ-SO subcutaneously at a dose of 10 mg/kg
               and 15 mg/kg BW, respectively. Blood samples were collected from
               the jugular vein at different times between 1 and 120 h after
               drug administrations. The plasma concentrations of ABZ-SO and

               comparative drug systemic exposure (IVM plasma concentrations)
               and nematodicidal efficacies (clinical efficacy) in lambs were
               determined for a reference (RF) and two different test (T1, T2)

               healthy Corriedale lambs, naturally infected with multiple

  abstract  = "Anthelmintic drugs require effective concentrations to be
               attained at the site of parasite location for a certain period

               distribution, metabolism and excretion (pharmacokinetic phase)
               directly influence drug concentrations attained at the site of
               action and the resultant pharmacological effect. The aim of the
               current review article was to provide an overview of the
               relationship between the pharmacokinetic features of different
               anthelmintic drugs, their availability in host tissues,
               accumulation within target helminths and resulting therapeutic
               efficacy. It focuses on the anthelmintics used in cattle and
               sheep for which published information on the overall topic is
               available; benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones and monepantel.
               Physicochemical properties, such as water solubility and
               dissolution rate, determine the ability of anthelmintic
               compounds to accumulate in the target parasites and consequently
               final clinical efficacy. The transcuticular absorption process
               is the main route of penetration for different drugs in
               nematodes and cestodes. However, oral ingestion is a main route
               of drug entry into adult liver flukes. Among other factors, the
               route of administration may substantially affect the
               pharmacokinetic behaviour of anthelmintic molecules and modify
               their efficacy. Oral administration improves drug efficacy
               against nematodes located in the gastroinestinal tract
               especially if parasites have a reduced susceptibility.
               Partitioning of the drug between gastrointestinal contents,
               mucosal tissue and the target parasite is important to enhance
               the drug exposure of the nematodes located in the lumen of the
               abomasum and/or small intestine. On the other hand, large
               inter-animal variability in drug exposure and subsequent high
               variability in efficacy is observed after topical administration
               of anthelmintic compounds. As it has been extensively
               demonstrated under experimental and field conditions,
               understanding pharmacokinetic behaviour and identification of
               different factors affecting drug activity is important for
               achieving optimal parasite control and avoiding selection for
               drug resistance. The search for novel alternatives to deliver
               enhanced drug concentrations within target helminth parasites
               may contribute to avoiding misuse, and prolong the lifespan of

               class of anthelmintics because of our high dependence on them
               for the control of nematode parasites and some ectoparasites in
               livestock, companion animals and in humans. However, resistance
               to MLs is of increasing concern. Resistance is commonplace
               throughout the world in nematode parasites of small ruminants
               and is of increasing concern in horses, cattle, dogs and other
               animals. It is suspected in Onchocerca volvulus in humans. In
               most animals, resistance first arose to the avermectins, such as
               ivermectin (IVM), and subsequently to moxidectin (MOX). Usually
               when parasite populations are ML-resistant, MOX is more
               effective than avermectins. MOX may have higher intrinsic
               potency against some parasites, especially filarial nematodes,
               than the avermectins. However, it clearly has a significantly
               different pharmacokinetic profile. It is highly distributed to
               lipid tissues, less likely to be removed by ABC efflux
               transporters, is poorly metabolized and has a long half-life.
               This results in effective concentrations persisting for longer
               in target hosts. It also has a high safety index. Limited data
               suggest that anthelmintic resistance may be overcome, at least
               temporarily, if a high concentration can be maintained at the
               site of the parasites for a prolonged period of time. Because of
               the properties of MOX, there are reasonable prospects that
               strains of parasites that are resistant to avermectins at
               currently recommended doses will be controlled by MOX if it can
               be administered at sufficiently high doses and in formulations
               that enhance its persistence in the host. This review examines
               the properties of MOX that support this contention and compares
               them with the properties of other MLs. The case for using MOX to
               better control ML-resistant parasites is summarised and some
               outstanding research questions are presented.",

               resistance genes with 2 alleles each. Because little is known of
               the genetics of resistance to anthelmintics in cyathostomins,
               the first use of this model was to compare the effect of
               different assumptions regarding the inheritance of resistance on
               model outputs. Comparisons were made between single and two-gene
               inheritance, where the heterozygote survival was dominant,
               intermediate or recessive under treatment, and with or without a
               fitness disadvantage associated with the resistance mechanism.
               Resistance developed fastest when the heterozygotes survived
               anthelmintic treatment (i.e., were dominant) and slowest when
               they did not (i.e., were recessive). Resistance was slower to
               develop when inheritance was poly-genic compared to a single
               gene, and when there was a fitness cost associated with the
               resistance mechanism, although the latter variable was the least
               influential. Importantly, while these genetic factors sometimes
               had a large influence on the rate at which resistant genotypes
               built up in the model populations, their order of ranking was
               always the same, when different anthelmintic use strategies were
               compared. Therefore, the described model is a useful tool for
               evaluating different treatment and management strategies on
               their potential to select for resistance.",

              susceptibility to pathogens is of fundamental importance across a
              wide swathe of biology. Much theoretical and empirical effort has
              focused on genetic variants of large effect, but pathogen
              susceptibility often appears to be a polygenic complex trait.
              Here we investigate the quantitative genetics of survival over
              120 hours of exposure (``susceptibility'') of C. elegans to three
              bacterial pathogens of varying virulence, along with the

              (co)variance input by spontaneous mutations accumulated under
              minimal selection to the standing genetic (co)variance in a set
              of ∼50 wild isolates. Three conclusions emerge. First, with one
              exception, mutations increase susceptibility to pathogens, and
              susceptibility is uncorrelated with fitness in the absence of
              pathogens. Second, the orientation in trait space of the

               such as oligomeric proanthocyanidins. Half of the animals in

               immune responses and effects on the gut microbiome. Despite in
               vitro anthelmintic activity of GP-extracts, numbers of parasite

               eosinophils induced by A. suum infection in the duodenum,

               concern because it affects human health and our food supply, as
               both livestock and plants are affected. Two principal factors
               contribute to this problem. First, nematode resistance to
               anthelmintic drugs is increasing worldwide and second, many
               effective nematicides pose environmental hazards. In this paper
               we address this problem by deploying a high throughput screening
               platform for anthelmintic drug discovery using the nematode
               Caenorhabditis elegans as a surrogate for infectious nematodes.
               This method offers the possibility of identifying new
               anthelmintics in a cost-effective and timely manner.
               METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using our high throughput screening
               platform we have identified 14 new potential anthelmintics by
               screening more than 26,000 compounds from the Chembridge and
               Maybridge chemical libraries. Using phylogenetic profiling we
               identified a subset of the 14 compounds as potential
               anthelmintics based on the relative sensitivity of C. elegans
               when compared to yeast and mammalian cells in culture. We showed
               that a subset of these compounds might employ mechanisms
               distinct from currently used anthelmintics by testing diverse
               drug resistant strains of C. elegans. One of these newly
               identified compounds targets mitochondrial complex II, and we
               used structural analysis of the target to suggest how
               differential binding of this compound may account for its
               different effects in nematodes versus mammalian cells.
               CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The challenge of anthelmintic drug
               discovery is exacerbated by several factors; including, 1) the
               biochemical similarity between host and parasite genomes, 2) the
               geographic location of parasitic nematodes and 3) the rapid
               development of resistance. Accordingly, an approach that can
               screen large compound collections rapidly is required. C.
               elegans as a surrogate parasite offers the ability to screen
               compounds rapidly and, equally importantly, with specificity,
               thus reducing the potential toxicity of these compounds to the
               host and the environment. We believe this approach will help to
               replenish the pipeline of potential nematicides.",

               pose a clinical problem in acquired hospital infections. Here,
               we investigated three Gram-negative members of the ESKAPE group,
               Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter
               baumannii. Pathogenicity profiles as measured by time to kill
               adult C. elegans showed that P. aeruginosa was the most
               pathogenic, followed by K. pneumoniae, while C. elegans cultured
               on A. baumannii exhibited the same survival as those on the
               standard laboratory food source for C. elegans, Escherichia coli
               OP50. The pathogenicity was paralleled by a reduction in time
               that C. elegans resided on the bacterial lawn with the most
               pathogenic strains triggering an increase in the frequency of
               food-leaving. Previous reports indicate that gut colonization is
               a feature of pathogenicity, but we found that the most
               pathogenic strains were not associated with the highest level of
               colonization. Indeed, clearance of P. aeruginosa strains from
               the C. elegans gut was independent of bacterial pathogenicity.
               We show that this clearance is regulated by neuromodulation as
               C. elegans mutants in unc-31 and egl-3 have enhanced clearance
               of P. aeruginosa. Intriguingly this is also not linked to their
               pathogenicity. It is likely that there is a dynamic balance
               occurring in the C. elegans intestinal environment between

               demand for modern and safe treatment options against
               helminthoses is obvious. In addition to the optimisation of
               existing drug classes, two major objectives are in the focus of
               research to increase treatment options against helminth
               infections: (i) the evaluation of combinations, to increase the
               anthelmintic spectrum, to improve the efficacy of the respective
               drugs and to decelerate the development of resistance and (ii)
               the identification and development of safe and highly
               efficacious new drug classes with novel, resistance-breaking
               modes of action. The present cumulative thesis, consisting of
               five publications, describes investigations addressing both of
               the above mentioned aspects by comparing the potential of the
               aminophenylamidines amidantel, tribendimidine and deacylated
               amidantel (dAMD) and of the cyclooctadepsipeptides emodepside
               and PF1022A for the treatment against helminth infections of
               humans and animals in monotherapy as well as in several
               combinations. Since activitiy of the nematicidal
               aminophenylamidines against cestodes has already been published,
               but respective reports were somewhat informal, publication 1
               aimed on the evaluation of the efficacy of tribendimidine and
               dAMD against the tapeworm Hymenolepis microstoma in a controlled
               laboratory trial. Whereas treatments with three dosages of up to
               100 mg/kg dAMD did not result in any significant reduction of
               the worm burdens, in marked contrast, treatments with 3$\times$
               50 mg/kg tribendimidine, which is the parent compound of dAMD,
               resulted in high parasite clearance. In publication 2,
               substantial concentration-dependent anthelmintic potencies of
               aminophenylamidines and cyclooctadepsipeptides as well as of
               some drug combinations were detected against larval and adult
               stages of the rat hookworm Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and
               against first larval stages of Trichinella spiralis using three
               in vitro assays. Consequently, in publication 3 the same
               derivatives were found to be highly efficacious using the N.
               brasiliensis in vivo model in rats. Moreover, tested drug
               combinations of two cholinergic drugs or an aminophenylamidine
               plus a cyclooctadepsipeptide resulted in additive effects,
               making not only the individual drugs but also combinations
               interesting for further evaluation. Furthermore, a
               pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that after oral administration
               of tribendimidine, only its metabolite dAMD was detectable in
               rat blood samples. Finally, electron microscopic analysis of
               hookworms treated with the test compounds revealed information
               about their mode of action. Worms treated with PF1022A showed
               signs of flaccid paralysis, whereas individuals treated with
               cholinergic drugs including aminophenylamidines and levamisole,
               showed strong contraction along the whole body of the worm
               suggesting spastic paralysis. Following the establishment and
               parasitological characterisation of a Trichuris muris mouse
               model, publication 4 investigated the in vivo potency of the
               aminophenylamidines and the cyclooctadepsipeptides against
               patent whipworm infections using three consecutive dosages by
               different routes of administration. Only treatments with
               relatively high dosages of tribendimidine or dAMD resulted in
               complete elimination of the worm burden whereas treatments with
               fairly low dosages of the cyclooctadepsipeptides emodepside and
               PF1022A, especially after oral administration, resulted in full
               parasite clearance. Due to the high efficacy, PF1022A was
               further evaluated in single and multiple oral treatment schemes
               targeting developmental stages including histotropic larvae.
               Again, dose-dependent efficacies were observed. However, using a
               single dose regimen, only high dosages cured the larval whipworm
               infections completely. But since only a very basic formulation
               was tested, reduction of the required dosages can likely be
               achieved by optimisation of the formulation. The
               cyclooctadepsipeptides showed high efficacy against all nematode
               species tested. However, their mode of action is not fully
               understood. The calcium-gated and voltage-dependent potassium
               channel SLO-1 is generally accepted to be crucial for the
               nematicidal effects of cyclooctadepsipeptides in Caenorhabditis
               elegans but direct activation of SLO-1 channels by any
               cyclooctadepsipeptide has not been demonstrated. Therefore,
               manuscript 5 reports the identification and characterisation of
               SLO-1 channels from various nematodes. After identification and
               cloning of slo-1 orthologs from a wide phylogenetic range of
               parasitic nematodes, SLO-1 and its potential activation by
               cyclooctadepsipeptides were analysed by heterologous expression
               in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Accordingly, it was demonstrated for
               the first time, that emodepside directly induces currents via C.
               elegans SLO-1. Due to the obtained insights regarding their mode
               of action and their potential to cure helminthoses in a
               single-treatment regimen, the cyclooctadepsipeptides might
               currently be the most interesting new class for the treatment
               against helminthoses of human and livestock. In addition to
               monotherapies, the use of combinations containing
               cyclooctadepsipeptides and cholinergic drugs such as
               tribendimidine should also be further investigated. The
               combinations were shown to have increased efficacy against the
               rat hookworm and presumably the risk of selection for resistance
               would be decreased, since two completely independent targets are
               affected.",

              many parasitic nematode species and has become a major constraint
              to livestock production in many parts of the world. In spite of
              its increasing importance, there is still a poor understanding of
              the molecular and genetic basis of resistance. It is unclear
              which mutations contribute most to the resistance phenotype and
              how resistance alleles arise, are selected and spread in parasite
              populations. The main strategy used to identify mutations
              responsible for anthelmintic resistance has been to undertake
              experimental studies on candidate genes. These genes have been
              chosen predominantly on the basis of our knowledge of drug
              mode-of-action and the identification of mutations that can
              confer resistance in model organisms. The application of these
              approaches to the analysis of benzimidazole and ivermectin
              resistance is reviewed and the reasons for their relative success
              or failure are discussed. The inherent limitation of candidate
              gene studies is that they rely on very specific and narrow
              assumptions about the likely identity of resistance-associated
              genes. In contrast, forward genetic and functional genomic
              approaches do not make such assumptions, as illustrated by the

               Against that backdrop, Upjohn Animal Health (now Pfizer Animal
               Health) established a discovery program to identify compounds
               with novel modes of action and effective against several
               important nematode species, including strains resistant to the
               major classes of anthelmintics. This testing led to the
               discovery of 2-deoxy-paraherquamide (derquantel) -- the first of
               the spiroindole class of anthelmintics with commercial utility.
               Derquantel was prepared semisynthetically by chemical reduction
               of paraherquamide, isolated from fermentation extracts of
               Penicillium simplicissimum. It was subsequently shown that
               derquantel is a nicotinic cholinergic antagonist. During
               clinical development, derquantel was combined with the
               macrocyclic lactone, abamectin. The combination of the new
               chemical with a second anthelmintic from a different chemical
               class in a single product (Startect) provides a more complete
               spectrum of anthelmintic activity and efficacy against resistant
               strains. Additionally, the combination also offers a means of
               minimizing selection for resistance to derquantel through the
               use of abamectin with a second, distinct mode of action, thereby

               Populations in Hawaii, California, New York and Nova Scotia are
               polymorphic for Wolbachia, typically with <20\% infection
               frequency. The Wolbachia in D. suzukii, denoted wSuz, is closely
               related to wRi, the variant prevalent in continental populations
               of D. simulans. wSuz is also nearly identical to Wolbachia found
               in D. subpulchrella, plausibly D. suzukii's sister species. This
               suggests vertical Wolbachia transmission through cladogenesis
               ('cladogenic transmission'). The widespread occurrence of 7-20\%
               infection frequencies indicates a stable polymorphism. wSuz is
               imperfectly maternally transmitted, with wild infected females
               producing on average 5-10\% uninfected progeny. As expected from
               its low frequency, wSuz produces no cytoplasmic incompatibility
               (CI), that is, no increased embryo mortality when infected males
               mate with uninfected females, and no appreciable sex-ratio
               distortion. The persistence of wSuz despite imperfect maternal
               transmission suggests positive fitness effects. Assuming a
               balance between selection and imperfect transmission, we expect
               a fitness advantage on the order of 20\%. Unexpectedly,
               Wolbachia-infected females produce fewer progeny than do
               uninfected females. We do not yet understand the maintenance of
               wSuz in D. suzukii. The absence of detectable CI in D. suzukii
               and D. subpulchrella makes it unlikely that CI-based mechanisms
               could be used to control this species without transinfection
               using novel Wolbachia. Contrary to their reputation as
               horizontally transmitted reproductive parasites, many Wolbachia
               infections are acquired through introgression or cladogenesis
               and many cause no appreciable reproductive manipulation. Such

              Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and Necator
              americanus/Ancylostoma duodenale are among the most widespread
              parasites worldwide. Despite the global expansion of preventive
              anthelmintic treatment, standard operating procedures to monitor
              anthelmintic drug efficacy are lacking. The objective of this
              study, therefore, was to define the efficacy of a single 400
              milligram dose of albendazole (ALB) against these three STH using
              a standardized protocol. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Seven
              trials were undertaken among school children in Brazil, Cameroon,
              Cambodia, Ethiopia, India, Tanzania and Vietnam. Efficacy was
              assessed by the Cure Rate (CR) and the Fecal Egg Count Reduction
              (FECR) using the McMaster egg counting technique to determine
              fecal egg counts (FEC). Overall, the highest CRs were observed
              for A. lumbricoides (98.2\%) followed by hookworms (87.8\%) and
              T. trichiura (46.6\%). There was considerable variation in the CR
              for the three parasites across trials (country), by age or the
              pre-intervention FEC (pre-treatment). The latter is probably the
              most important as it had a considerable effect on the CR of all
              three STH. Therapeutic efficacies, as reflected by the FECRs,
              were very high for A. lumbricoides (99.5\%) and hookworms
              (94.8\%) but significantly lower for T. trichiura (50.8\%), and
              were affected to different extents among the 3 species by the
              pre-intervention FEC counts and trial (country), but not by sex
              or age. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that a
              FECR (based on arithmetic means) of >95\% for A. lumbricoides and
              >90\% for hookworms should be the expected minimum in all future
              surveys, and that therapeutic efficacy below this level following
              a single dose of ALB should be viewed with concern in light of
              potential drug resistance. A standard threshold for efficacy
              against T. trichiura has yet to be established, as a single-dose
              of ALB is unlikely to be satisfactory for this parasite. TRIAL

              557 patients), 95\% (95\% CI, 91\%-97\%; 309 patients), and 88\%
              (95\% CI, 79\%-93\%; 131 patients), respectively. Cure rates for
              infection with T trichiura following treatment with single-dose
              oral albendazole and mebendazole were 28\% (95\% CI, 13\%-39\%;
              735 patients) and 36\% (95\% CI, 16\%-51\%; 685 patients),
              respectively. The efficacy of single-dose oral albendazole,
              mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate against hookworm infections was
              72\% (95\% CI, 59\%-81\%; 742 patients), 15\% (95\% CI, 1\%-27\%;
              853 patients), and 31\% (95\% CI, 19\%-42\%; 152 patients),
              respectively. No pooled relative risks could be calculated for
              pyrantel pamoate against T trichiura and levamisole for any of
              the parasites investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose oral
              albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate show high cure
              rates against A lumbricoides. For hookworm infection, albendazole

  abstract = "Parasitic nematodes represent formidable pathogens of humans,
              livestock and crop plants. Control of these parasites is almost
              exclusively dependent on a small group of anthelmintic drugs, the
              most important of which belong to the macrocyclic lactone class.
              The extensive use of these drugs to control the ubiquitous
              trichostrongylid parasites of grazing livestock has resulted in
              the emergence of both single and multi-drug resistance. The
              expectation is that this resistance will eventually occur in the
              human parasites such as the common and debilitating soil
              transmitted nematodes and vector-borne filarial nematodes. While
              the modes of action of anthelmintics such as ivermectin, have
              been elucidated, notably in the model nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans, the molecular nature of this resistance remains to be
              fully determined. Here we show that the anterior amphids play a
              key role in ivermectin uptake and mutations in these sensory
              structures result in ivermectin resistance in C. elegans. Random
              genetic mutant screens, detailed analysis of existing amphid
              mutants and lipophilic dye uptake indicate that the non-motile
              ciliated amphid neurons are a major route of ivermectin ingress;
              the majority of the mutants characterised in this study are
              predicted to be involved in intraflagellar transport. In addition
              to a role in ivermectin resistance, a subset of the amphid
              mutants are resistant to the non-related benzimidazole class of
              anthelmintics, raising the potential link to a multi-drug
              resistance mechanism. The amphid structures are present in all
              nematodes and are clearly defined in a drug-sensitive strain of
              Haemonchus contortus. It is predicted that amphidial drug uptake
              and intraflagellar transport may prove to be significant in the
              development of single and multi-drug resistance in the nematode
              pathogens of veterinary and human importance.",

              resistance to the potent anthelmintic levamisole. Mutants at the
              7 loci conferring the most extreme resistance generally possess
              almost identical visible and pharmacological phenotypes:
              uncoordinated motor behavior, most severe in early larval life,
              extreme resistance to cholinergic agonists and sensitivity to
              hypo-osmotic shock. Mutants with exceptional phenotypes suggest
              possible functions for several of the resistance loci. The most
              extreme mutants can readily be selected by their drug resistance
              (211 mutants, as many as 74 alleles of one gene). The more common
              resistance loci are likely to be unessential genes, while loci

              simple animal. The extreme drug resistance of these mutants makes
              them useful tools for the genetic manipulation of C. elegans.

              pharmacologically functional acetyl-choline receptors (LEWIS et

               dangerous infectious diseases that have emerged in recent
               history. Human CoV strains discovered during previous SARS
               outbreaks have been hypothesized to pass from bats to humans
               using intermediate hosts, e.g. civets for SARS-CoV and camels
               for MERS-CoV. The discovery of an intermediate host of
               SARS-CoV-2 and the identification of specific mechanism of its
               emergence in humans are topics of primary evolutionary
               importance. In this study we investigate the evolutionary
               patterns of 11 main genes of SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies
               suggested that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to the
               horseshoe bat coronavirus RaTG13 for most of the genes and to
               some Malayan pangolin coronavirus (CoV) strains for the receptor
               binding (RB) domain of the spike protein.Results We provide a
               detailed list of statistically significant horizontal gene
               transfer and recombination events (both intergenic and
               intragenic) inferred for each of 11 main genes of the SARS-Cov-2
               genome. Our analysis reveals that two continuous regions of
               genes S and N of SARS-CoV-2 may result from intragenic
               recombination between RaTG13 and Guangdong (GD) Pangolin CoVs.
               Statistically significant gene transfer-recombination events
               between RaTG13 and GD Pangolin CoV have been identified in
               region [1215-1425] of gene S and region [534-727] of gene N.
               Moreover, some significant recombination events between the
               ancestors of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, GD Pangolin CoV and bat CoV
               ZC45-ZXC21 coronaviruses have been identified in genes ORF1ab,
               S, ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8 and N. Furthermore, topology-based
               clustering of gene trees inferred for 25 CoV organisms revealed
               a three-way evolution of coronavirus genes, with gene
               phylogenies of ORF1ab, S and N forming the first cluster, gene
               phylogenies of ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8 forming
               the second cluster, and phylogeny of gene ORF10 forming the
               third cluster.Conclusions The results of our horizontal gene
               transfer and recombination analysis suggest that SARS-Cov-2
               could not only be a chimera resulting from recombination of the
               bat RaTG13 and Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses but also a close
               relative of the bat CoV ZC45 and ZXC21 strains. They also
               indicate that a GD pangolin may be an intermediate host of
               SARS-CoV-2.",

               poverty, safety, and inefficient public health policy have
               marginalized drug development and distribution to control
               infection in humans. Anthelmintics (anti-worm drugs) have
               historically been developed and tested for treatment of
               non-human parasitic nematodes that infect livestock and
               companion animals. Here we systematically compare the in vitro

               vitro and in vivo can vary greatly among these nematode species,
               e.g., the efficacy of albendazole is strong on A. ceylanicum but

               vitro effects of the drugs can be seen, e.g., nitazoxanide
               consistently shows an all-or-nothing response. Our in vitro data
               suggest that further optimization of the clinical efficacy of
               some of these anthelmintics could be achieved by altering the
               treatment routine and/or dosing. Most importantly, our in vitro
               and in vivo data indicate that the hookworm A. ceylanicum is a
               particularly sensitive and useful model for anthelmintic studies
               and should be incorporated early on in drug screens for

               the phyla, including humans. Moreover, nematodes that parasitise
               plants are a global problem for agriculture. As such, these

               production, on the welfare of companion animals and on crop
               production. In the 21st century there are two major challenges
               posed by the wide-spread prevalence of parasitic nematodes.
               First, many anthelmintic drugs are losing their effectiveness
               because nematode strains with resistance are emerging. Second,
               serious concerns regarding the environmental impact of the
               nematicides used for crop protection have prompted legislation
               to remove them from use, leaving agriculture at increased risk
               from nematode pests. There is clearly a need for a concerted
               effort to address these challenges. Over the last few decades
               the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has provided the
               opportunity to use molecular genetic techniques for mode of
               action studies for anthelmintics and nematicides. These
               approaches continue to be of considerable value. Less fruitful
               so far, but nonetheless potentially very useful, has been the
               direct use of C. elegans for anthelmintic and nematicide
               discovery programmes. Here we provide an introduction to the use
               of C. elegans as a `model' parasitic nematode, briefly review
               the study of nematode control using C. elegans and highlight
               approaches that have been of particular value with a view to
               facilitating wider-use of C. elegans as a platform for

               antinematode drugs) available today to treat these infections
               are rapidly losing their efficacy as multidrug resistance in
               parasites becomes a global health challenge. We propose an
               engineering approach to discover an anthelmintic drug
               combination that is more potent at killing wild-type
               Caenorhabditis elegans worms than four individual drugs. In the
               experiment, freely swimming single worms are enclosed in
               microfluidic drug environments to assess the centroid velocity
               and track curvature of worm movements. After analyzing the
               behavioral data in every iteration, the feedback system control
               (FSC) scheme is used to predict new drug combinations to test.
               Through a differential evolutionary search, the winning drug
               combination is reached that produces minimal centroid velocity
               and high track curvature, while requiring each drug in less than
               their EC50 concentrations. The FSC approach is model-less and
               does not need any information on the drug pharmacology,
               signaling pathways, or animal biology. Toward combating
               multidrug resistance, the method presented here is applicable to

               morbidity worldwide. Few anthelmintics are available for
               treatment, and only one is commonly used in mass drug
               administrations. New anthelmintics are urgently needed, and
               crystal (Cry) proteins made by Bacillus thuringiensis are
               promising new candidates. Combination drug therapies are
               considered the ideal treatment for infectious diseases.
               Surprisingly, little work has been done to define the
               characteristics of anthelmintic combinations. Here, by means of
               quantitative assays with wild-type and mutants of the roundworm

               anthelmintic combinations using Cry proteins and nicotinic
               acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists, e.g., tribendimidine

               like Cry5B and Cry21A, mutually display what is known in the HIV
               field as hypersusceptibility--when the nematodes become
               resistant to either class, they become hypersensitive to the
               other class. Furthermore, we find that when Cry5B and nAChR
               agonists are combined, their activities are strongly
               synergistic, producing combination index values as good or
               better than seen with antitumor, anti-HIV, and insecticide

               anthelmintic combination therapies can be examined and
               demonstrate that the combination of nAChR agonists and Cry
               proteins has excellent properties and is predicted to give

              cherry (Prunus avium), peach (Prunus persica), and apple (Malus
              domestica). These plants biosynthesize amygdalin in defense
              against herbivore animals, as amygdalin generates poisonous
              cyanide upon plant tissue destruction.1-4 Poisonous to many
              animals, amygdalin-derived cyanide is detoxified by potent
              enzymes commonly found in bacteria and plants but not most
              animals.5 Here we show that the nematode C. elegans can detoxify
              amygdalin by a genetic pathway comprising cysl-1, egl-9, hif-1,
              and cysl-2. A screen of a natural product library for
              hypoxia-independent regulators of HIF-1 identifies amygdalin as a
              potent activator of cysl-2, a HIF-1 transcriptional target that
              encodes a cyanide detoxification enzyme in C. elegans. As a
              cysl-2 paralog similarly essential for amygdalin resistance,
              cysl-1 encodes a protein homologous to cysteine biosynthetic
              enzymes in bacteria and plants but functionally co-opted in C.
              elegans. We identify exclusively HIF-activating egl-9 mutations
              in a cysl-1 suppressor screen and show that cysl-1 confers
              amygdalin resistance by regulating HIF-1-dependent cysl-2
              transcription to protect against amygdalin toxicity. Phylogenetic
              analysis indicates that cysl-1 and cysl-2 were likely acquired
              from green algae through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and
              functionally co-opted in protection against amygdalin. Since
              acquisition, these two genes evolved division of labor in a
              cellular circuit to detect and detoxify cyanide. Thus,
              algae-to-nematode HGT and subsequent gene function co-option

              microbiomes, endosymbionts, parasites and other cobionts.
              Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria are found in a diversity of
              terrestrial arthropods and nematodes, with supergroups A and B
              the most common in insects. We identified and assembled 110
              complete Wolbachia genomes from 93 host species spanning 92
              families by filtering data from 368 insect species generated by
              the Darwin Tree of Life project. From 15 infected species we
              assembled more than one Wolbachia genome, including cases where
              individuals carried simultaneous supergroup A and B infections.
              Different insect orders had distinct patterns of infection, with
              Lepidopteran hosts mostly infected with supergroup B, while
              infections in Diptera and Hymenoptera were dominated by A-type

              associations, host and Wolbachia phylogenies revealed no (or very

              A and B genomes had distinct GC\% and GC skew, and B genomes had

               The method relies on the generation of deep coverage of all the

               technology, and using aggregate properties of the different
               genomes to identify read sets belonging to each. This

               neurotransmitters that have previously been proposed to modulate
               nervous system activity and behaviours of their hosts2,3.
               However, the mechanistic basis of this microbiota-brain
               signalling and its physiological relevance are largely unknown.
               Here we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the neuromodulator
               tyramine produced by commensal Providencia bacteria, which
               colonize the gut, bypasses the requirement for host tyramine
               biosynthesis and manipulates a host sensory decision.
               Bacterially produced tyramine is probably converted to
               octopamine by the host tyramine $\beta$-hydroxylase enzyme.
               Octopamine, in turn, targets the OCTR-1 octopamine receptor on
               ASH nociceptive neurons to modulate an aversive olfactory
               response. We identify the genes that are required for tyramine
               biosynthesis in Providencia, and show that these genes are
               necessary for the modulation of host behaviour. We further find
               that C. elegans colonized by Providencia preferentially select
               these bacteria in food choice assays, and that this selection
               bias requires bacterially produced tyramine and host octopamine
               signalling. Our results demonstrate that a neurotransmitter
               produced by gut bacteria mimics the functions of the cognate
               host molecule to override host control of a sensory decision,
               and thereby promotes fitness of both the host and the

               The bacterium Bacillus subtilis protects Caenorhabditis elegans
               nematodes from heat shock by increasing host fecundity compared
               to the nonprotective Escherichia coli. In this study, we ask how
               the protection provided by the bacterium affects the host's

               between hosts heat shocked on B. subtilis versus E. coli, we

               increase the rate of host adaptation to a stressful environment.

               regulate transposable element (TE) activity. Approximately
               12-16\% of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome is composed of TEs,
               of which the majority are likely inactive. However, most studies
               of TE activity have been conducted in the laboratory strain N2,
               which limits our knowledge of the effects of these mobile
               elements across natural populations. We analyzed the
               distribution and abundance of TEs in 208 wild C. elegans strains
               to better understand how transposons contribute to variation in
               natural populations. We identified 3,397 TEs as compared with
               the reference strain, of which 2,771 are novel insertions and
               241 are TEs that have been excised in at least one wild strain.

               The abundances of TEs reflect their activities, and these data

               infection in B16. In contrast, complementation with the intact
               genes restored most of the above-mentioned deficient phenotypes,
               which indicated that the spo0A gene was a key factor in the
               smart attack of B16 on C. elegans. Further, transcriptome,
               molecular simulations and quantitative PCR analysis showed that
               morpholine from C. elegans could promote sporulation and
               initiate infection by increasing the transcription of the spo0A
               gene by decreasing the transcription of the rapA and spo0E
               genes. The overexpression of rapA or spo0E decreased the induced
               sporulation effect, and morpholine directly reduced the level of
               phosphorylation of purified recombinant RapA and Spo0E compared
               to that of Spo0A. Collectively, these findings further support a
               'Trojan horse-like' infection model. The significance of our

              health of humans and livestock throughout the world. Anthelmintic
              drugs are the first line of defense against these infections.
              Unfortunately, resistance to these drugs is rampant and continues
              to spread. To improve treatment strategies, we must understand
              the genetics and molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance.
              Studies of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans and the free-living
              nematode Caenorhabditis elegans discovered that a beta-tubulin
              gene is mutated in benzimidazole (BZ) resistant strains. In
              parasitic nematode populations, three beta-tubulin alleles,
              F167Y, E198A, and F200Y, have long been correlated with
              resistance. Additionally, improvements in sequencing technologies
              have identified new alleles - E198V, E198L, E198K, E198I, and
              E198Stop - also correlated with BZ resistance. However, none of
              these alleles have been proven to cause resistance. To
              empirically demonstrate this point, we independently introduced
              the F167Y, E198A, and F200Y alleles as well as two of the newly
              identified alleles, E198V and E198L, into the BZ susceptible C.

              genome-edited strains were exposed to both albendazole and
              fenbendazole to quantitatively measure animal responses to BZs.
              We used a range of concentrations for each BZ compound to define
              response curves and found that all five of the alleles conferred
              resistance to BZ compounds equal to a loss of the entire
              beta-tubulin gene. These results prove that the parasite
              beta-tubulin alleles cause resistance. The E198V allele is found
              at low frequencies along with the E198L allele in natural
              parasite populations, suggesting that it could affect fitness. We
              performed competitive fitness assays and demonstrated that the
              E198V allele reduces animal health, supporting the hypothesis
              that this allele might be less fit in field populations. Overall,

              allele was present in T. circumcincta and H. contortus
              populations, but two alleles were found in a fewer number of

              benzimidazole-resistance alleles already present before the
              isolation of populations had been selected. On the other hand,
              the fact that some benzimidazole-resistance alleles were specific
              to one population of T. circumcincta or H. contortus, seems to be
              in agreement with the hypothesis of the selection of spontaneous
              mutations. Thus, the origin of benzimidazole-resistance alleles
              in trichostrongylid nematodes seems to involve primarily the

               different to those previously reported in other organisms
               including nematode parasites or fungi and provide new candidate
               polymorphisms to be investigated in parasitic nematode species
               including human parasites where resistance is poorly understood.
               They may also represent new residues important for drug binding.
               In addition, presence of these resistance conferring
               polymorphisms in wild populations of a free-living nematode may
               indicate benzimidazole drug residues in the environment having a
               significant impact on natural fauna. Finally, the presence of
               null ben-1 $\beta$-tubulin alleles in wild C. elegans

  abstract = "Increasing anthelmintic resistance (AR) in livestock has
              stimulated growing efforts to monitor anthelmintic effectiveness
              (AE) on livestock farms. On-farm assessment of AE relies on
              measuring the reduction in faecal egg count (FEC) following
              treatment; and if conducted rigorously, qualifies as a formal FEC
              reduction test (FECRT) for AR. Substantial research effort has
              been devoted to designing robust protocols for the FECRT and its
              statistical interpretation; however, a wide range of factors
              other than AR can affect FEC reduction on farms. These are not
              always possible to control, and can affect the outcome and
              repeatability of AE measurements and confound the on-farm
              classification of AR using FECRT. This review considers
              confounders of FEC reduction, focusing on gastrointestinal
              nematodes of ruminants, including host and parasite physiology
              and demography; pharmacokinetic variation between drugs,
              parasites and hosts; and technical performance. Drug formulation
              and delivery, host condition and diet, and seasonal variation in
              parasite species composition, can all affect AE and hence
              observed FEC reduction. Causes of variation in FEC reduction
              should be attenuated, but this is not always possible. Regular
              monitoring of AE can indicate a need to improve anthelmintic
              administration practices, and detect AR early in its progression.
              Careful interpretation of FEC reduction, however, taking into
              account possible confounders, is essential before attributing
              reduced FEC reduction to AR. Understanding of confounders of FEC
              reduction will complement advances in FECRT design and

              preserve a proportion of the parasite population in 'refugia',
              unexposed to treatment. While persuasive in its logic, and widely
              advocated as best practice, evidence for the ability of
              refugia-based approaches to slow the development of drug
              resistance in parasitic helminths is currently limited. Moreover,
              the conditions needed for refugia to work, or how transferable
              those are between parasite-host systems, are not known. This
              review, born of an international workshop, seeks to deconstruct
              the concept of refugia and examine its assumptions and
              applicability in different situations. We conclude that factors
              potentially important to refugia, such as the fitness cost of
              drug resistance, the degree of mixing between parasite
              sub-populations selected through treatment or not, and the impact
              of parasite life-history, genetics and environment on the
              population dynamics of resistance, vary widely between systems.
              The success of attempts to generate refugia to limit anthelmintic
              drug resistance are therefore likely to be highly dependent on
              the system in hand. Additional research is needed on the concept

              Discoveries of the modes of action of these drugs and mechanisms

              health of humans and livestock throughout the world. Anthelmintic
              drugs are the first line of defense against these infections.
              Unfortunately, resistance to these drugs is rampant and continues
              to spread. To improve treatment strategies, we must understand
              the genetics and molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance.
              Studies of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans and the free-living
              nematode Caenorhabditis elegans discovered that a beta-tubulin
              gene is mutated in benzimidazole (BZ) resistant strains. In
              parasitic nematode populations, three beta-tubulin alleles,
              F167Y, E198A, and F200Y, have long been correlated with
              resistance. Additionally, improvements in sequencing technologies
              have identified new alleles - E198V, E198L, E198K, E198I, and
              E198Stop - also correlated with BZ resistance. However, none of
              these alleles have been proven to cause resistance. To
              empirically demonstrate this point, we independently introduced
              the F167Y, E198A, and F200Y alleles as well as two of the newly
              identified alleles, E198V and E198L, into the BZ susceptible C.

              genome-edited strains were exposed to both albendazole and
              fenbendazole to quantitatively measure animal responses to BZs.
              We used a range of concentrations for each BZ compound to define
              response curves and found that all five of the alleles conferred
              resistance to BZ compounds equal to a loss of the entire
              beta-tubulin gene. These results prove that the parasite
              beta-tubulin alleles cause resistance. The E198V allele is found
              at low frequencies along with the E198L allele in natural
              parasite populations, suggesting that it could affect fitness. We
              performed competitive fitness assays and demonstrated that the
              E198V allele reduces animal health, supporting the hypothesis
              that this allele might be less fit in field populations. Overall,
              we present a powerful platform to quantitatively assess
              anthelmintic resistance and effects of specific resistance

              extremely common and increasing worldwide. It is essential to
              understand the mechanisms of resistance to slow its spread.
              Recently, four new parasitic nematode beta-tubulin alleles have
              been identified in benzimidazole (BZ) resistant parasite
              populations: E198I, E198K, E198T, and E198stop. These alleles
              have not been tested for the ability to confer resistance or for
              any effects that they might have on organismal fitness. We
              introduced these four new alleles into the sensitive C. elegans
              laboratory-adapted N2 strain and exposed these genome-edited
              strains to both albendazole and fenbendazole. We found that all
              four alleles conferred resistance to both BZ drugs. Additionally,
              we tested for fitness consequences in both control and
              albendazole conditions over seven generations in competitive
              fitness assays. We found that none of the edited alleles had
              deleterious effects on fitness in control conditions and that all
              four alleles conferred strong and equivalent fitness benefits in
              BZ drug conditions. Because it is unknown if previously validated
              alleles confer a dominant or recessive BZ resistance phenotype,
              we tested the phenotypes caused by five of these alleles and
              found that none of them conferred a dominant BZ resistance
              phenotype. Accurate measurements of resistance, fitness effects,
              and dominance caused by the resistance alleles allow for the
              generation of better models of population dynamics and facilitate

              small-molecule tools is target identification. Here we show that
              Caenorhabditis elegans can provide a platform for both the
              discovery of new bioactive compounds and target identification.
              We screened 14,100 small molecules for bioactivity in wild-type
              worms and identified 308 compounds that induce a variety of
              phenotypes. One compound that we named nemadipine-A induces
              marked defects in morphology and egg-laying. Nemadipine-A
              resembles a class of widely prescribed anti-hypertension drugs
              called the 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs) that antagonize the
              alpha1-subunit of L-type calcium channels. Through a genetic
              suppressor screen, we identified egl-19 as the sole candidate
              target of nemadipine-A, a conclusion that is supported by several
              additional lines of evidence. egl-19 encodes the only L-type
              calcium channel alpha1-subunit in the C. elegans genome. We show
              that nemadipine-A can also antagonize vertebrate L-type calcium
              channels, demonstrating that worms and vertebrates share the
              orthologous protein target. Conversely, FDA-approved DHPs fail to
              elicit robust phenotypes, making nemadipine-A a unique tool to
              screen for genetic interactions with this important class of
              drugs. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of nemadipine-A by
              using it to reveal redundancy among three calcium channels in the
              egg-laying circuit. Our study demonstrates that C. elegans
              enables rapid identification of new small-molecule tools and

              the beginning of the 1990s. PF1022A, the starting material of
              emodepside, is a natural secondary metabolite of the fungus
              Mycelia sterilia, which belongs to the microflora of the leaves
              of Camellia japonica. PF1022A consists of four
              N-methyl-L-leucins, two D-Iactic acids and two D-phenyllactic
              acids, which build up a cyclic octadepsipeptide with an
              alternating L-D-L-configuration. Emodepside is a semisynthetic
              derivative of PF1022A, which contains a morpholine attached in
              para position at each of both D-phenyllactic acids. Emodepside is
              efficacious against a variety of gastrointestinal nematodes.
              Emodepside binds to a presynaptic latrophilin receptor in

              via activation of Gqalpha protein and phospholipase-Cbeta, which

              role in presynaptic vesicle-functioning. This finally leads to

              health of humans and livestock throughout the world. Anthelmintic
              drugs are the first line of defense against these infections.
              Unfortunately, resistance to these drugs is rampant and continues
              to spread. To improve treatment strategies, we must understand
              the genetics and molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance.
              Studies of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans and the free-living
              nematode Caenorhabditis elegans discovered that a beta-tubulin
              gene is mutated in benzimidazole (BZ) resistant strains. In
              parasitic nematode populations, three beta-tubulin alleles,
              F167Y, E198A, and F200Y, have long been correlated with
              resistance. Additionally, improvements in sequencing technologies
              have identified new alleles - E198V, E198L, E198K, E198I, and
              E198Stop - also correlated with BZ resistance. However, none of
              these alleles have been proven to cause resistance. To
              empirically demonstrate this point, we independently introduced
              the F167Y, E198A, and F200Y alleles as well as two of the newly
              identified alleles, E198V and E198L, into the BZ susceptible C.
              elegans N2 genetic background using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. These
              genome-edited strains were exposed to both albendazole and
              fenbendazole to quantitatively measure animal responses to BZs.
              We used a range of concentrations for each BZ compound to define
              response curves and found that all five of the alleles conferred
              resistance to BZ compounds equal to a loss of the entire
              beta-tubulin gene. These results prove that the parasite
              beta-tubulin alleles cause resistance. The E198V allele is found
              at low frequencies along with the E198L allele in natural
              parasite populations, suggesting that it could affect fitness. We
              performed competitive fitness assays and demonstrated that the
              E198V allele reduces animal health, supporting the hypothesis
              that this allele might be less fit in field populations. Overall,

              GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT Fourteen C. elegans strains are used in three
              individual studies. PD1074, the anchor control strain (orange),
              is grown alongside test strains (green, yellow, purple). Multiple
              biological replicates of PD1074 captures environmental variation
              in growth conditions. Non-polar and polar metabolic data across
              the three studies ( i . e ., natural strains, central metabolism
              mutants, and UGT mutants) were collected by nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass
              spectrometry (LC-MS). Data acquisition controls in each block
              included biological reference material and pooled PD1074 samples.
              Biological replicates of PD1074 (n = 42 for LC-MS, n = 52 for
              NMR) were included in all batches. Meta-analysis provided

  abstract  = "Anthelmintic resistance is a major problem for the control of
               parasitic nematodes of livestock and of growing concern for
               human parasite control. However, there is little understanding
               of how resistance arises and spreads or of the ``genetic
               signature'' of selection for this group of important pathogens.
               We have investigated these questions in the system for which
               anthelmintic resistance is most advanced; benzimidazole
               resistance in the sheep parasites Haemonchus contortus and
               Teladorsagia circumcincta. Population genetic analysis with
               neutral microsatellite markers reveals that T. circumcincta has
               higher genetic diversity but lower genetic differentiation
               between farms than H. contortus in the UK. We propose that this
               is due to epidemiological differences between the two parasites
               resulting in greater seasonal bottlenecking of H. contortus.
               There is a remarkably high level of resistance haplotype
               diversity in both parasites compared with drug resistance
               studies in other eukaryotic systems. Our analysis suggests a
               minimum of four independent origins of resistance mutations on
               just seven farms for H. contortus, and even more for T.
               circumincta. Both hard and soft selective sweeps have occurred
               with striking differences between individual farms. The sweeps
               are generally softer for T. circumcincta than H. contortus,
               consistent with its higher level of genetic diversity and
               consequent greater availability of new mutations. We propose a
               model in which multiple independent resistance mutations
               recurrently arise and spread by migration to explain the
               widespread occurrence of resistance in these parasites. Finally,
               in spite of the complex haplotypic diversity, we show that
               selection can be detected at the target locus using simple
               measures of genetic diversity and departures from neutrality.
               This work has important implications for the application of
               genome-wide approaches to identify new anthelmintic resistance
               loci and the likelihood of anthelmintic resistance emerging as

               high-productivity farm animals proportionate insufficient
               resources for adequate coping with stressful conditions.
               Significant differences between breeds and within breeds are
               seen, as well as genotype vs. environment interactions. With
               improvement of genetic host resistance to infection,
               transmission of infection will be impacted. On the other hand,
               genetic improvement of resilience can lead to a reduction in
               clinical signs of disease, but not necessarily reduce
               transmission of infection to other animals. Faecal egg count
               (FEC) is the main measurement used to evaluate helminthiasis
               load, despite the fact that the protocols and analytical methods
               can affect the results, and the FEC data frequently shows
               aggregative, negative skewed distribution, and a high
               coefficient of variation. Mass selection where heritability is
               generally medium to low generally produces slow results and low

               and most studies have concentrated on chromosomes where the

               onchocerciasis, or ``river blindness''. Ivermectin has been used
               for mass treatment of onchocerciasis for up to 18 years, and
               recently there have been reports of poor parasitological
               responses to the drug. Should ivermectin resistance be
               developing, it would have a genetic basis. We monitored genetic
               changes in parasites obtained from the same patients before use
               of ivermectin and following different levels of ivermectin
               exposure. METHODS AND FINDINGS: O. volvulus adult worms were
               obtained from 73 patients before exposure to ivermectin and in
               the same patients following three years of annual or
               three-monthly treatment at 150 microg/kg or 800 microg/kg.
               Genotype frequencies were determined in beta-tubulin, a gene
               previously found to be linked to ivermectin selection and
               resistance in parasitic nematodes. Such frequencies were also
               determined in two other genes, heat shock protein 60 and acidic
               ribosomal protein, not known to be linked to ivermectin effects.
               In addition, we investigated the relationship between
               beta-tubulin genotype and female parasite fertility. We found a
               significant selection for beta-tubulin heterozygotes in female
               worms. There was no significant selection for the two other
               genes. Quarterly ivermectin treatment over three years reduced
               the frequency of the beta-tubulin ``aa'' homozygotes from 68.6\%
               to 25.6\%, while the ``ab'' heterozygotes increased from 20.9\%
               to 69.2\% in the female parasites. The female worms that were
               homozygous at the beta-tubulin locus were more fertile than the
               heterozygous female worms before treatment (67\% versus 37\%; p
               = 0.003) and twelve months after the last dose of ivermectin in
               the groups treated annually (60\% versus 17\%; p<0.001).
               Differences in fertility between heterozygous and homozygous
               worms were less apparent three months after the last treatment
               in the groups treated three-monthly. CONCLUSIONS: The results
               indicate that ivermectin is causing genetic selection on O.
               volvulus. This genetic selection is associated with a lower
               reproductive rate in the female parasites. We hypothesize that
               this genetic selection indicates that a population of O.
               volvulus, which is more tolerant to ivermectin, is being
               selected. This selection could have implications for the
               development of ivermectin resistance in O. volvulus and for the
               ongoing onchocerciasis control programmes.",

               veterinary practice. Much of the research conducted to date has

               Both the interpretation of candidate gene studies and the

               the model to explore if increased refugia, provided by leaving
               some adult sheep untreated, would delay development of
               anthelmintic resistance without compromising nematode control.
               PROCEDURES: Compare model predictions with field observations
               from a breeding flock in Armidale, NSW. Simulate the impact of
               leaving 1-10\% of adult sheep untreated in diverse sheep-grazing
               systems. RESULTS: Predicted populations of Tr. colubriformis and
               T. circumcincta were less than those observed in the field,
               attributed to nutritional stress experienced by the sheep during
               drought and not accounted for by the model. Observed variation
               in faecal egg counts explained by the model (R(2) ) for these
               species was 40-50\%. The H. contortus populations and R(2) were
               both low. Leaving some sheep untreated worked best in situations
               where animals were already grazing or were moved onto pastures
               with low populations of infective larvae. In those cases,
               anthelmintic resistance was delayed and nematode control was
               maintained when 1-4\% of adult stock remained untreated.
               CONCLUSIONS: In general, the model predicted that leaving more
               than 4\% of adults untreated did not sufficiently delay the
               development of anthelmintic resistance to justify the increased
               production risk from such a strategy. The choice of a drug
               rotation strategy had an equal or larger effect on nematode
               control, and selection for resistance, than leaving 1-10\% of
               adults untreated.",

               on selecting for anthelmintic resistance on Australian sheep
               farms. DESIGN: A computer simulation model predicted populations
               of Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Haemonchus contortus or
               Teladorsagia (Ostertagia) circumcincta, and the frequency of
               anthelmintic resistance genes. METHOD: Nematode populations and
               the progression of drug resistance for a variety of treatment
               options and management practices in sheep-rearing areas of
               Western Australia (WA), Victoria (VIC) and New South Wales (NSW)
               were simulated. A scoring system was devised to measure the
               success of each option in delaying resistance to each
               anthelmintic and in controlling nematode populations. RESULTS:
               The best option at all sites was combining the new anthelmintic
               (monepantel) with a triple mixture of benzimidazole, levamisole
               and abamectin (COM). The next best option was: in NSW, rotation
               at each treatment between monepantel, moxidectin and COM; in
               VIC, rotation at each treatment between monepantel and COM; and
               in WA, rotation at each treatment between monepantel (used in
               winter) and COM or moxidectin (used in summer-autumn). In WA,
               rapid selection for resistance occurred as a consequence of
               summer-autumn treatments; however, if a small percentage of
               adult stock were left untreated then this selection could be
               greatly reduced. Despite purposely assuming relatively high
               resistance to benzimidazole and levamisole, COM was still
               effective in controlling worms and delaying resistance.
               CONCLUSIONS: Because of cost constraints, it may not be feasible
               or profitable for producers to always use the combination of all
               drugs. However, the second- and third-best options still
               considerably slowed the development of anthelmintic resistance.",

              inhibited larvae. The major mechanisms underlying resistance to
              T. circumcincta appear to be the IgA mediated suppression of worm
              growth and the mast cell mediated regulation of worm number. Mast
              cell responses are slow to develop, possibly because they are
              responsible for protein loss and reduced growth of the host. Two
              genes have been repeatedly associated with resistance to T.

              the interferon-gamma locus on chromosome 3. Although the

              administration has reduced morbidity and transmission throughout
              Africa and Central/South America. Mass drug administration is
              likely to exert selection pressure on parasites, and phenotypic
              and genetic changes in several Onchocerca volvulus populations
              from Cameroon and Ghana-exposed to more than a decade of regular
              ivermectin treatment-have raised concern that sub-optimal
              responses to ivermectin's anti-fecundity effect are becoming more
              frequent and may spread. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Pooled
              next generation sequencing (Pool-seq) was used to characterise
              genetic diversity within and between 108 adult female worms
              differing in ivermectin treatment history and response.
              Genome-wide analyses revealed genetic variation that
              significantly differentiated good responder (GR) and sub-optimal
              responder (SOR) parasites. These variants were not randomly
              distributed but clustered in ~31 quantitative trait loci (QTLs),
              with little overlap in putative QTL position and gene content
              between the two countries. Published candidate ivermectin SOR
              genes were largely absent in these regions; QTLs differentiating
              GR and SOR worms were enriched for genes in molecular pathways
              associated with neurotransmission, development, and stress
              responses. Finally, single worm genotyping demonstrated that
              geographic isolation and genetic change over time (in the
              presence of drug exposure) had a significantly greater role in
              shaping genetic diversity than the evolution of SOR.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study is one of the first
              genome-wide association analyses in a parasitic nematode, and
              provides insight into the genomics of ivermectin response and
              population structure of O. volvulus. We argue that ivermectin
              response is a polygenically-determined quantitative trait (QT)
              whereby identical or related molecular pathways but not
              necessarily individual genes are likely to determine the extent
              of ivermectin response in different parasite populations.
              Furthermore, we propose that genetic drift rather than genetic
              selection of SOR is the underlying driver of population
              differentiation, which has significant implications for the
              emergence and potential spread of SOR within and between these
              parasite populations.",

               of nervous system development, one may ask whether the
               generation of its highly diverse sets of constituents, that is,
               distinct neuronal cell types, relies on genetic mechanisms that
               share specific common features. Specifically, are there common
               patterns in the function of regulatory genes across different
               neuron types and are those regulatory mechanisms not only used
               in different parts of one nervous system, but are they conserved
               across animal phylogeny? We address these questions here by
               focusing on one specific, highly conserved and well-studied
               regulatory factor, the POU homeodomain transcription factor
               UNC-86. Work over the last 30 years has revealed a common and

               neuron types in which Caenorhabditis elegans unc-86 is

               functionally distinct identity determinants of specific neuron
               types. Mouse orthologs of unc-86, the Brn3 genes, have been
               shown to fulfill a similar function in initiating and
               maintaining neuronal identity in specific parts of the mouse
               brain and similar functions appear to be carried out by the sole
               Drosophila ortholog, Acj6. The terminal selector function of

               framework for the null hypothesis that the expected temporal
               profile stays at 0. This leads to our one-sample MB-statistic

               Hotelling T²-statistic. Both the MB-statistic and T̃²-statistic
               can be used to rank genes in the order of evidence of nonzero
               mean, incorporating the correlation structure across time
               points, moderation and replication. We also derive the
               corresponding MB-statistics and T̃²-statistics for the
               one-sample problem where the null hypothesis states that the
               expected temporal profile is constant, and for the two-sample

              the use of anthelmintics. However, this drug arsenal is limited,
              and resistance against most anthelmintics is widespread.
              Emodepside is a new anthelmintic drug effective against
              gastrointestinal and filarial nematodes. Nematodes that are
              resistant to other anthelmintic drug classes are susceptible to
              emodepside, indicating that the emodepside mode of action is
              distinct from previous anthelmintics. The laboratory-adapted
              Caenorhabditis elegans strain N2 is sensitive to emodepside, and
              genetic selection and in vitro experiments implicated slo-1, a
              large K+ conductance (BK) channel gene, in emodepside mode of
              action. In an effort to understand how natural populations will
              respond to emodepside, we measured brood sizes and developmental
              rates of wild C. elegans strains after exposure to the drug and

              variation in C. elegans emodepside responses correlates with
              amino acid substitutions in slo-1, but genetic mechanisms other
              than slo-1 coding variants likely underlie emodepside resistance
              in wild C. elegans strains. Additionally, the assayed strains
              have higher offspring production in low concentrations of
              emodepside (a hormetic effect). We find that natural variation

              reproductive and survival traits are shaped by selection through

              known about the genetic and cellular mechanisms that control and
              couple these tradeoffs. Here, we find that two laboratory-adapted
              strains of C. elegans descended from a single common ancestor
              that lived in the 1950s have differences in a number of
              life-history traits, including reproductive timing, lifespan,
              dauer formation, growth rate, and offspring number. We identified
              a quantitative trait locus (QTL) of large effect that controls
              24\%-75\% of the total trait variance in reproductive timing at
              various timepoints. Using CRISPR/Cas9-induced genome editing, we
              show this QTL is due in part to a 60 bp deletion in the 3' end of
              the nurf-1 gene, which is orthologous to the human gene encoding
              the BPTF component of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex.
              Besides reproduction, nurf-1 also regulates growth rate,
              lifespan, and dauer formation. The fitness consequences of this
              deletion are environment specific-it increases fitness in the
              growth conditions where it was fixed but decreases fitness in
              alternative laboratory growth conditions. We propose that
              chromatin remodeling, acting through nurf-1, is a pleiotropic
              regulator of life history trade-offs underlying the evolution of

               Although metrics on similarity associated with taxonomic

               hampered by false positives that are difficult to track.

              starvation resistance is technically challenging. We developed a
              synthetic-population (re)sequencing approach using molecular
              inversion probes (MIP-seq) to measure relative fitness during and
              after larval starvation in Caenorhabditis elegans. We applied
              this competitive assay to 100 genetically diverse, sequenced,
              wild strains, revealing natural variation in starvation
              resistance. We confirmed that the most starvation-resistant
              strains survive and recover from starvation better than the most
              starvation-sensitive strains using standard assays. We performed
              genome-wide association (GWA) with the MIP-seq trait data and
              identified three quantitative trait loci (QTL) for starvation
              resistance, and we created near isogenic lines (NILs) to validate
              the effect of these QTL on the trait. These QTL contain numerous
              candidate genes including several members of the Insulin/EGF
              Receptor-L Domain (irld) family. We used genome editing to show
              that four different irld genes have modest effects on starvation
              resistance. Natural variants of irld-39 and irld-52 affect
              starvation resistance, and increased resistance of the irld-39;
              irld-52 double mutant depends on daf-16/FoxO. DAF-16/FoxO is a
              widely conserved transcriptional effector of insulin/IGF
              signaling (IIS), and these results suggest that IRLD proteins
              modify IIS, although they may act through other mechanisms as
              well. This work demonstrates efficacy of using MIP-seq to dissect
              a complex trait and it suggests that irld genes are natural

               infections, although their efficacy is increasingly compromised
               by resistance. The primary underlying mechanisms for BZ
               resistance are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
               isotype 1 $\beta$-tubulin gene causing the substitutions F167Y,
               E198A or F200Y. However, resistance is believed to be
               multi-genic and previous studies have shown that isolates
               carrying 90--100\% F200Y can vary considerably in their
               resistance level in the egg hatch assay (EHA). Cytochrome P450
               monooxygenases (CYPs) are associated with drug resistance in
               mammals and arthropods and have been considered as mediators of
               anthelmintic resistance. In Caenorhabditis elegans, several
               members of the CYP34/35 and CYP31 families are BZ and/or
               xenobiotic inducible and thiabendazole (TBZ) is metabolised by
               CYP35D1. Here, expression of all 5 CYPs closely related to the
               C. elegans CYP34/35 and CYP31 families was investigated in
               fourth-stage larvae of two susceptible and three BZ-resistant
               Haemonchus contortus isolates following in vitro exposure to TBZ
               for 3 and 6 h using real-time RT-PCR. The resistance status of
               all isolates was determined using EHAs and quantification of
               resistance-associated $\beta$-tubulin SNPs using pyrosequencing.
               While none of the CYPs was TBZ inducible, constitutive
               expression of CYP34/35 family member HCOI100383400 was
               significantly 2.4--3.7-fold higher in the multi-drug resistant
               WR isolate with the strongest BZ resistance phenotype compared
               to susceptible and intermediate-level BZ-resistant isolates.
               Although this increase is only moderate, HCOI100383400 might
               still be involved in high-level BZ resistance by further
               decreasing susceptibility in isolates already carrying 100\% of
               a $\beta$-tubulin SNP causing BZ resistance. Lower transcript
               levels were observed for all CYPs in the intermediately
               resistant IRE isolate in comparison to the susceptible HcH
               isolate, which, except for CYP HCOI01579500, were statistically
               non-significant. This suggests that none of the investigated

               filariasis with distressing and disturbing symptoms like
               elephantiasis; and river blindness. Filarial diseases affect
               millions of people in 73 countries throughout the topics and
               sub-tropics. The drugs available for mass drug administration,
               (ivermectin, albendazole and diethylcarbamazine), are
               ineffective against adult filariae (macrofilariae) at the
               registered dosing regimen; this generates a real and urgent need
               to identify effective macrofilaricides. Emodepside, a veterinary
               anthelmintic registered for treatment of nematode infections in
               cats and dogs, is reported to have macrofilaricidal effects.
               Here, we explore the mode of action of emodepside using adult
               Brugia malayi, one of the species that causes lymphatic
               filariasis. Whole-parasite motility measurement with Worminator
               and patch-clamp of single muscle cells show that emodepside
               potently inhibits motility by activating voltage-gated potassium
               channels and that the male is more sensitive than the female.
               RNAi knock down suggests that emodepside targets SLO-1 K
               channels. We expressed slo-1 isoforms, with alternatively
               spliced exons at the RCK1 (Regulator of Conductance of
               Potassium) domain, heterologously in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We
               discovered that the slo-1f isoform, found in muscles of males,
               is more sensitive to emodepside than the slo-1a isoform found in
               muscles of females; and selective RNAi of the slo-1a isoform in
               female worms increased emodepside potency. In Onchocerca
               volvulus, that causes river blindness, we found two isoforms in
               adult females with homology to Bma-SLO-1A and Bma-SLO-1F at the
               RCK1 domain. In silico modeling identified an emodepside binding
               pocket in the same RCK1 region of different species of filaria
               that is affected by these splice variations. Our observations
               show that emodepside has potent macrofilaricidal effects and
               alternative splicing in the RCK1 binding pocket affects potency.
               Therefore, the evaluation of potential sex-dependent effects of
               an anthelmintic compound is of importance to prevent any

               into technology and consumer products. In 2014, over 300 tons of
               copper oxide nanoparticles were manufactured in the United
               States. The increased production of nanoparticles raises
               concerns regarding the potential introduction into the
               environment or human exposure. Copper oxide nanoparticles
               commonly release copper ions into solutions, which contribute to
               their toxicity. We quantified the inhibitory effects of both
               copper oxide nanoparticles and copper sulfate on C. elegans
               toxicological endpoints to elucidate their biological effects.
               Several toxicological endpoints were analyzed in C. elegans,
               including nematode reproduction, feeding behavior, and average
               body length. We examined three wild C. elegans isolates together
               with the Bristol N2 laboratory strain to explore the influence
               of different genotypic backgrounds on the physiological response
               to copper challenge. All strains exhibited greater sensitivity
               to copper oxide nanoparticles compared to copper sulfate, as
               indicated by reduction of average body length and feeding
               behavior. Reproduction was significantly reduced only at the
               highest copper dose, though still more pronounced with copper
               oxide nanoparticles compared to copper sulfate treatment.
               Furthermore, we investigated the effects of copper oxide
               nanoparticles and copper sulfate on neurons, cells with known
               vulnerability to heavy metal toxicity. Degeneration of
               dopaminergic neurons was observed in up to 10\% of the
               population after copper oxide nanoparticle exposure.
               Additionally, mutants in the divalent-metal transporters, smf-1
               or smf-2, showed increased tolerance to copper exposure,
               implicating both transporters in copper-induced
               neurodegeneration. These results highlight the complex nature of
               CuO nanoparticle toxicity, in which a nanoparticle-specific
               effect was observed in some traits (average body length, feeding
               behavior) and a copper ion specific effect was observed for
               other traits (neurodegeneration, response to stress).",

               Since its first release in 2009, MetaboAnalyst has evolved
               significantly to meet the ever-expanding bioinformatics demands
               from the rapidly growing metabolomics community. In addition to
               providing a variety of data processing and normalization
               procedures, MetaboAnalyst supports a wide array of functions for
               statistical, functional, as well as data visualization tasks.
               Some of the most widely used approaches include PCA (principal
               component analysis), PLS-DA (partial least squares discriminant
               analysis), clustering analysis and visualization, MSEA
               (metabolite set enrichment analysis), MetPA (metabolic pathway
               analysis), biomarker selection via ROC (receiver operating
               characteristic) curve analysis, as well as time series and power
               analysis. The current version of MetaboAnalyst (4.0) features a
               complete overhaul of the user interface and significantly
               expanded underlying knowledge bases (compound database, pathway

              first release in 2009, MetaboAnalyst has evolved significantly to
              meet the ever-expanding bioinformatics demands from the rapidly
              growing metabolomics community. In addition to providing a
              variety of data processing and normalization procedures,
              MetaboAnalyst supports a wide array of functions for statistical,
              functional, as well as data visualization tasks. Some of the most
              widely used approaches include PCA (principal component
              analysis), PLS-DA (partial least squares discriminant analysis),
              clustering analysis and visualization, MSEA (metabolite set

               drugs targeting helminths (anthelmintics) typically belong to

               proteins and biological processes in these parasites, resulting
               in widespread multidrug resistance and creating a need to
               develop new anthelmintics. Due to challenges specific to working
               with parasitic helminths, molecular and genetic data relevant to
               most helminths were relatively sparse until recently.
               Fortunately, the advent of next-generation sequencing resulted
               in the accumulation of large amounts of omics data, which in
               combination with chemogenomic screening and the development of
               high-throughput screening techniques for certain helminth
               species and Caenorhabditis elegans has now made it possible to

              secretomes from adipose tissue (hADSCs), bone marrow (hBMSCs),
              and umbilical cord Wharton's jelly (hWJSCs). hMSC secretomes were
              obtained under xenofree conditions and analyzed by liquid
              chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). Biological
              processes related to angiogenesis were found to be enriched in
              the proteomic profile of hMSC secretomes. hWJSC secretomes
              revealed a more complete angiogenic network with higher
              concentrations of angiogenesis related proteins, followed by
              hBMSC secretomes. hADSC secretomes lacked central angiogenic
              proteins and expressed most detected proteins to a significantly
              lower level. In vivo all secretomes induced vascularization of
              subcutaneously implanted Matrigel plugs in mice. Differences in
              secretome composition were functionally analyzed with monocyte
              and endothelial cell (EC) in vitro co-culture experiments using
              vi-SNE based multidimensional flow cytometry data analysis.
              Functional responses between hBMSC and hWJSC secretomes were

              hADSC secretomes. Both secretomes also induced a more profound

              secretome as the most potent hMSC source for
              inflammation-mediated angiogenesis induction, while the potency
              of hADSC secretomes was lowest. This systematic analysis may have

               they have the same mode of action, differences in terms of
               selection for drug resistance have been reported. Our objective
               was to study and compare changes occurring upon ivermectin or
               moxidectin selection in the model nematode Caenorhabditis
               elegans C. elegans worms were submitted to stepwise exposure to
               increasing doses of moxidectin. The sensitivity of
               moxidectin-selected worms to MLs was determined in a larval
               development assay and compared with those of wild-type and
               ivermectin-selected strains. Selection with either ivermectin or
               moxidectin led to acquired tolerance to ivermectin, moxidectin,
               and eprinomectin. Importantly, moxidectin was the most potent ML
               in both ivermectin- and moxidectin-selected strains.
               Interestingly, this order of potency was also observed in a
               resistant Haemonchus contortus isolate. In addition, ivermectin-
               and moxidectin-selected strains displayed constitutive
               overexpression of several genes involved in xenobiotic
               metabolism and transport. Moreover, verapamil potentiated

               lactone (ML) ring, but are fermentation products of different
               organisms. The principal structural difference is that
               avermectins have sugar groups at C13 of the macrocyclic ring,
               whereas the milbemycins are protonated at C13. Moxidectin (MOX),
               belonging to the milbemycin family, has other differences,
               including a methoxime at C23. The avermectins and MOX have
               broad-spectrum activity against nematodes and arthropods. They
               have similar but not identical, spectral ranges of activity and
               some avermectins and MOX have diverse formulations for great
               user flexibility. The longer half-life of MOX and its safety
               profile, allow MOX to be used in long-acting formulations. Some
               important differences between MOX and avermectins in interaction
               with various invertebrate ligand-gated ion channels are known
               and could be the basis of different efficacy and safety
               profiles. Modelling of IVM interaction with glutamate-gated ion
               channels suggest different interactions will occur with MOX.
               Similarly, profound differences between MOX and the avermectins
               are seen in interactions with ABC transporters in mammals and
               nematodes. These differences are important for pharmacokinetics,
               toxicity in animals with defective transporter expression, and
               probable mechanisms of resistance. Resistance to the avermectins
               has become widespread in parasites of some hosts and MOX
               resistance also exists and is increasing. There is some degree
               of cross-resistance between the avermectins and MOX, but
               avermectin resistance and MOX resistance are not identical. In
               many cases when resistance to avermectins is noticed, MOX
               produces a higher efficacy and quite often is fully effective at
               recommended dose rates. These similarities and differences
               should be appreciated for optimal decisions about parasite
               control, delaying, managing or reversing resistances, and also

               serious problem worldwide. Ivermectin, an avermectin, and
               moxidectin, a milbemycin, are potent endectocides commonly used
               to control these parasites. The proposed mode of action of
               avermectins and possibly the milbemycins involves the binding of
               the drug to the alpha-subunit of a glutamate-gated chloride
               channel, which opens or potentiates gating of the channel and
               leads to the hyperpolarization of the target neuromuscular cell.
               Glutamate gates the channel by binding to the beta-subunit. We
               have cloned a fragment of a putative alpha-subunit gene from
               Haemonchus contortus. The sequence of the beta subunit is

               treatment have been administered to communities and there are
               reports of poor parasitological responses to treatment.
               Understanding ivermectin resistance and ivermectin selection is
               an important step to reduce selection pressure for resistance,
               and to develop molecular markers which can be used to monitor
               the development of resistance and its spread. Here we report
               evidence that ivermectin selection changes the frequency of
               $\beta$-tubulin alleles in both the sheep parasite, H.
               contortus, and the human parasite, O. volvulus. In O. volvulus

               alleles in O. volvulus obtained before any ivermectin was used

               contortus, we have been able to look at the frequency of
               $\beta$-tubulin alleles in a strain which has not seen any
               anthelmintic selection and in an ivermectin selected strain
               derived from the unselected strain. We have found ivermectin

               ivermectin selects for specific single nucleotide polymorphisms

               results in three amino acid changes in the H3 helix of
               $\beta$-tubulin, as well as deletions in an associated intron.
               We report a simple PCR assay to detect the amplicon length

               veterinary medicine and the control of some nematode infections
               in humans, such as onchocerciasais, lymphatic filariasis in
               Africa and strongyloidiasis. Unfortunately, IVM resistance is
               now a serious problem for parasite control in livestock and
               there is a concern about resistance development and spread in
               nematode parasites of humans. IVM is believed to act by opening
               glutamate-gated chloride channels and GABA-gated channels in
               invertebrate neurons or muscle cells, leading to
               hyperpolarisation of the cells and to an inhibitory paralysis.
               However, in the filarial nematodes, it is not altogether clear
               that the effect of IVM is confined to these actions or even
               whether these are the most important. Alterations in some
               ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) receptor subunits may play a
               role in the mechanisms of IVM resistance in some nematodes, but
               the evidence that changes in LGICs are the most important cause
               of IVM resistance in nematodes is far from clear. What is
               evident is that IVM is an excellent substrate for some
               ATP-binding cassette transporters, IVM selects for changes in
               expression levels of ABC transporters, such as P-glycoproteins,
               and that altered levels of some ABC transporters contribute to
               IVM resistance. In addition, there is growing evidence that IVM
               selects on $\beta$-tubulin, at least in some nematodes. Based on
               these various mechanisms, which contribute to IVM resistance, it
               may become possible to develop panels of molecular markers for
               IVM resistance in different nematode parasites. In order to
               stimulate the development of such markers, an international

               Many successful anthelmintics, including ivermectin, levamisole
               and monepantel, are agonists of pentameric ligand-gated ion
               channels, suggesting that the unexploited pentameric ion
               channels encoded in parasite genomes may be suitable drug
               targets. We validated five members of the nematode-specific
               family of acetylcholine-gated chloride channels as targets of
               agonists with anthelmintic properties by ectopically expressing
               an ivermectin-gated chloride channel, AVR-15, in tissues that
               endogenously express the acetylcholine-gated chloride channels
               and using the effects of ivermectin to predict the effects of an
               acetylcholine-gated chloride channel agonist. In principle, our
               strategy can be applied to validate any ion channel as a
               putative anti-parasitic drug target.",

               chloride-channels. While previous functional studies of the
               ion-channels encoded by these resistant alleles have revealed
               alterations in ligand binding and response to the anthelmintics,
               we still do not know how these alleles are contributing to
               resistance in vivo. To understand the phenomenon of anthelmintic
               resistance in detail we need to link changes in the genes of
               individual parasites with their ability to resist the effects of
               anthelmintic exposure. We have determined the genotype of
               individual adult and larval H. contortus with respect to the
               glc-5 and lgc-37 genes linked with macrocyclic lactone

               believed to contribute to parasite killing. Both genes are
               linked with altered behavior in the absence of drug, providing
               evidence that genetic resistance may be associated with
               alterations in parasite biology. In the presence of macrocyclic
               lactones, both genes are associated with a degree of protection
               against drug action. Whether this protection may be effective
               under the application of anthelmintic as part of normal farm

               human and animal health globally. However, ivermectin resistance
               is widespread in veterinary helminths and there are growing
               concerns of sub-optimal responses to treatment in related
               helminths of humans. Despite decades of research, the genetic
               mechanisms underlying ivermectin resistance are poorly
               understood in parasitic helminths. This reflects significant
               uncertainty regarding the mode of action of ivermectin in
               parasitic helminths, and the genetic complexity of these
               organisms; parasitic helminths have large, rapidly evolving
               genomes and differences in evolutionary history and genetic
               background can confound comparisons between resistant and
               susceptible populations. We undertook a controlled genetic cross
               of a multi-drug resistant and a susceptible reference isolate of
               Haemonchus contortus, an economically important gastrointestinal
               nematode of sheep, and ivermectin-selected the F2 population for
               comparison with an untreated F2 control. RNA-seq analyses of
               male and female adults of all populations identified high
               transcriptomic differentiation between parental isolates, which
               was significantly reduced in the F2, allowing differences
               associated specifically with ivermectin resistance to be
               identified. In all resistant populations, there was constitutive
               upregulation of a single gene, HCON\_00155390:cky-1, a putative
               pharyngeal-expressed transcription factor, in a narrow locus on
               chromosome V previously shown to be under ivermectin selection.
               In addition, we detected sex-specific differences in gene
               expression between resistant and susceptible populations,
               including constitutive upregulation of a P-glycoprotein,
               HCON\_00162780:pgp-11, in resistant males only. After ivermectin
               selection, we identified differential expression of genes with
               roles in neuronal function and chloride homeostasis, which is
               consistent with an adaptive response to ivermectin-induced
               hyperpolarisation of neuromuscular cells. Overall, we show the
               utility of a genetic cross to identify differences in gene
               expression that are specific to ivermectin selection and provide

               data is driven by multiple sources, including biological
               variation in cellular state as well as technical variation
               introduced during experimental processing. Deconvolving these
               effects is a key challenge for preprocessing workflows. Recent
               work has demonstrated the importance and utility of count models
               for scRNA-seq analysis, but there is a lack of consensus on
               which statistical distributions and parameter settings are
               appropriate. RESULTS: Here, we analyze 59 scRNA-seq datasets
               that span a wide range of technologies, systems, and sequencing
               depths in order to evaluate the performance of different error
               models. We find that while a Poisson error model appears
               appropriate for sparse datasets, we observe clear evidence of
               overdispersion for genes with sufficient sequencing depth in all
               biological systems, necessitating the use of a negative binomial
               model. Moreover, we find that the degree of overdispersion
               varies widely across datasets, systems, and gene abundances, and
               argues for a data-driven approach for parameter estimation.
               CONCLUSIONS: Based on these analyses, we provide a set of

              morphological characterisation to differentiate species using
              microscopy-based techniques. However, molecular approaches based
              on the detection and quantification of parasite DNA are becoming
              more prevalent, increasing the sensitivity, specificity and
              throughput of diagnostic assays. High-throughput sequencing, from
              single PCR targets through to the analysis of whole genomes,
              offers significant promise towards providing information-rich
              data that may add value beyond traditional and conventional
              molecular approaches; however, thus far, its utility has not been
              fully explored to detect helminths in faecal samples. In this
              study, low-depth whole genome sequencing, i.e. genome skimming,
              has been applied to detect and characterise helminth diversity in
              a set of helminth-infected human and livestock faecal material.
              The strengths and limitations of this approach are evaluated
              using three methods to characterise and differentiate metagenomic
              sequencing data based on (i) mapping to whole mitochondrial
              genomes, (ii) whole genome assemblies, and (iii) a comprehensive
              internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) database, together with
              validation using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our analyses suggest
              that genome skimming can successfully identify most single and
              multi-species infections reported by qPCR and can provide
              sufficient coverage within some samples to resolve consensus
              mitochondrial genomes, thus facilitating phylogenetic analyses of
              selected genera, e.g. Ascaris spp. Key to this approach is both
              the availability and integrity of helminth reference genomes,
              some of which are currently contaminated with bacterial and host

               of small ruminants across the globe, which has a successful
               track record in IVM resistance. There are growing evidences
               regarding the multigenic nature of IVM resistance, and although

               using lower magnification of genome, the genetic basis of IVM

               often unique technical challenges. One challenge is that
               helminth parasites, particularly those in humans, are often
               difficult to obtain alive and in sufficient quantities for
               study; another is the challenge of studying these organisms in
               vitro - no helminth parasite life cycle has been fully
               recapitulated outside of a host. Arguably, the key issue
               retarding progress in helminth parasitology has been a lack of
               experimental tools and resources, certainly relative to the
               riches that have driven many parasitologists to adopt
               free-living model organisms as surrogate systems. In response to
               these needs, the past 10-12 years have seen the beginnings of
               helminth parasitology's journey into the 'omics' era, with the

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are about 22-nucleotide, small,
               noncoding RNAs that control gene expression
               post-transcriptionally. Helminth parasites usually express a
               unique repertoire of genes, including miRNAs, across different
               developmental stages with subtle regulatory mechanisms.
               OBJECTIVE: There is a necessity to investigate the involvement
               of miRNAs in the development of parasites, host-parasite
               interaction, immune evasion and their abilities to govern
               infection in hosts. MiRNAs present in helminth parasites have
               been summarized in the current systematic review (SR). METHODS:
               Electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest,
               Embase, and Google Scholar search engine, were searched to
               identify helminth miRNA studies published from February 1993
               till December 2019. Only the published articles in English were
               included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 1769 articles were
               preliminarily recorded. Following the strict inclusion and
               exclusion criteria, 105 studies were included in this SR. Most
               of these studies focused on the identification of miRNAs in
               helminth parasites and/or probing of differentially expressed
               host miRNA profiles in specific relevant tissues, while 12
               studies aimed to detect parasite-derived miRNAs in host
               circulating system and 15 studies characterized extracellular
               vesicles (EV)-derived miRNAs secreted by parasites. CONCLUSION:
               In the current SR, information regarding all miRNAs expressed in
               helminth parasites has been comprehensively provided and the
               utility of helminth parasitesderived miRNAs in diagnosis and
               control of parasitic infections has been discussed. Furthermore,
               functional studies on helminth-derived miRNAs have also been
               presented.",

               The study of cryptic species diversity in helminth parasites of
               human and veterinary importance has gained relevance, since
               their distribution may affect clinical and epidemiological
               features such as pathogenicity, virulence, drug resistance and
               susceptibility, mortality, and morbidity, ultimately affecting
               patient management, course, and outcome of treatment. At the
               same time, the need for recognition of cryptic species diversity

               use of definitions when reporting or describing new cryptic

               the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, against eggs of

               correlation analyses) to detect compounds that have a positive
               correlation with biological activity. Among the ten metabolites

               brevipolide, and one was a flavonoid. Combinations of

               the flavonoid, flavonoids combined with iridoid and
               phenylpropanoids, and saponins combined with phenylpropanoid.
               The positive correlation between classes of compounds in plants
               belonging to different genera and biological activity (as
               previously identified in the literature) reinforces the

               of chicory material were used: fresh chicory root pulp (from
               industrial chicory roots C. intybus var. sativum; ``Root
               Pulp''), fresh leaves from chicory cv. Spadona (sampled on four
               occasions) and fresh leaves from chicory cv. Choice. The
               resulting extracts were tested for anthelmintic activity against
               the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the pig
               nematode Ascaris suum. The cytotoxicity of the chicory extracts
               was evaluated on mammalian (Vero) cells. In the C. elegans
               assays, the Root Pulp was the most potent extract and induced
               paralysis in >95\% of worms exposed to >250 $\mu$g extract/mL
               (EC50 = 64.2 $\mu$g/mL). In the A. suum assays, the Root Pulp
               was also the most potent chicory extract to inhibit worm
               motility (EC50 = 87.6 $\mu$g/mL), followed closely by two of the
               Spadona leaf extracts (EC50 = 89.8 $\mu$g/mL and 112.2
               $\mu$g/mL) The Root Pulp extract had the lowest cytotoxicity of
               all tested extracts towards mammalian cells, with a selectivity
               index of 5.37. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that chicory
               Root Pulp had a markedly different chemical profile in
               comparison with forage chicory extracts. Molecular networking
               confirmed several SLs and SL-derivatives mainly present in
               chicory root pulp, that may be responsible of its potent
               anti-parasitic activity. Bioactivity-based molecular networking
               of chicory root pulp and the most potent forage chicory extracts
               revealed a high predicted anthelmintic score for the guaianolide
               SL 11,13-dihydro-lactucopicrin. In conclusion, chicory root pulp
               showed potent and selective in vitro anthelmintic activity
               against C. elegans and A. suum, with low cytotoxicity in
               mammalian cells. The promising anthelmintic activity of chicory
               root pulp should be confirmed in vivo to further explore the
               potential of this agro-industrial by-product as a nutraceutical
               anthelmintic for livestock and as novel source of anti-parasitic

              splicing, single-nucleotide (SNVs), and single-amino-acid

              Angiostrongylus costaricensis is a roundworm species that causes
              an intestinal inflammatory disease, known as abdominal
              angiostrongyliasis (AA). Currently, there is no drug available
              that acts directly on this parasite, mostly due to the sparse
              understanding of its molecular characteristics. The available

              a draft version that is not supported by transcript- or

               maintenance. Indeed, the immunomodulatory potency of helminths
               is attributed mainly to excretory/secretory products (ESPs). The
               ESPs of helminths and the identified small molecules (SM) are
               reported to have diverse biological and pharmacological
               properties. The available literature reports only limited
               metabolites, and the identity of many metabolites remains
               unknown due to limitations in the identification protocols and
               helminth-specific compound libraries. Many metabolites are known
               to be involved in host-parasite interactions and pathogenicity.
               For example, fatty acids (e.g., stearic acid) detected in the
               infective stages of helminths are known to have a role in host
               interaction through facilitating successful penetration and
               migration inside the host. Moreover, excreted/secreted SM
               detected in helminth species are found to possess various
               biological properties, including anti-inflammatory activities,
               suggesting their potential in developing immunomodulatory drugs.
               For example, helminths-derived somatic tissue extracts and whole
               crude ESPs showed anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the
               secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from human peripheral
               blood mononuclear cells and suppressing the pathology in
               chemically-induced experimental mice model of colitis. Unlike
               bigger molecules like proteins, SM are ideal candidates for drug
               development since they are small structures, malleable, and lack
               immunogenicity. Future studies should strive toward identifying
               unknown SM and isolating the under-explored niche of helminth
               metabolites using the latest metabolomics technologies and

               most importantly also affect animal well-being, in particular
               the swine industry. Host-helminth parasite interactions are
               complex and at the same time essential to understand the
               biology, dynamics and pathophysiology of these infections.
               Within these interactions, the immunomodulatory capacity of
               these helminths in the host has been extensively studied.
               Moreover, in recent years a growing interest on how helminths
               interact with the intestinal microbiota of the host has sparked,
               highlighting how this relationship plays an essential role in
               the establishment of initial infection, survival and persistence
               of the parasite, as well as in the development of chronic

  abstract  = "Small molecules are central to biology, mediating critical
               phenomena such as metabolism, signal transduction, mating
               attraction, and chemical defense. The traditional categories
               that define small molecules, such as metabolite, secondary
               metabolite, pheromone, hormone, and so forth, often overlap, and
               a single compound can appear under more than one functional
               heading. Therefore, we favor a unifying term, biogenic small
               molecules (BSMs), to describe any small molecule from a
               biological source. In a similar vein, two major fields of
               chemical research,natural products chemistry and metabolomics,
               have as their goal the identification of BSMs, either as a
               purified active compound (natural products chemistry) or as a
               biomarker of a particular biological state (metabolomics).
               Natural products chemistry has a long tradition of sophisticated
               techniques that allow identification of complex BSMs, but it
               often fails when dealing with complex mixtures. Metabolomics
               thrives with mixtures and uses the power of statistical analysis
               to isolate the proverbial ``needle from a haystack'', but it is
               often limited in the identification of active BSMs. We argue
               that the two fields of natural products chemistry and
               metabolomics have largely overlapping objectives: the
               identification of structures and functions of BSMs, which in
               nature almost inevitably occur as complex mixtures. Nuclear
               magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a central analytical
               technique common to most areas of BSM research. In this Account,
               we highlight several different NMR approaches to mixture
               analysis that illustrate the commonalities between traditional
               natural products chemistry and metabolomics. The primary focus
               here is two-dimensional (2D) NMR; because of space limitations,
               we do not discuss several other important techniques, including
               hyphenated methods that combine NMR with mass spectrometry and
               chromatography. We first describe the simplest approach of
               analyzing 2D NMR spectra of unfractionated mixtures to identify
               BSMs that are unstable to chemical isolation. We then show how
               the statistical method of covariance can be used to enhance the
               resolution of 2D NMR spectra and facilitate the semi-automated
               identification of individual components in a complex mixture.
               Comparative studies can be used with two or more samples, such
               as active vs inactive, diseased vs healthy, treated vs
               untreated, wild type vs mutant, and so on. We present two
               overall approaches to comparative studies: a simple but powerful
               method for comparing two 2D NMR spectra and a full statistical
               approach using multiple samples. The major bottleneck in all of
               these techniques is the rapid and reliable identification of
               unknown BSMs; the solution will require all the traditional
               approaches of both natural products chemistry and metabolomics

               coverage. To date, most published approaches have compared
               experimental methods by counting the total number of features
               detected. Due to artifactual interference, however, this number
               is highly variable and therefore is a poor metric for comparing
               metabolomic methods. Here we introduce an alternative approach
               to benchmarking metabolome coverage which relies on mixed
               Escherichia coli extracts from cells cultured in regular and
               (13)C-enriched media. After mass spectrometry-based metabolomic
               analysis of these extracts, we ``credential'' features arising
               from E. coli metabolites on the basis of isotope spacing and
               intensity. This credentialing platform enables us to accurately
               compare the number of nonartifactual features yielded by
               different experimental approaches. We highlight the value of our
               platform by reoptimizing a published untargeted metabolomic
               method for XCMS data processing. Compared to the published
               parameters, the new XCMS parameters decrease the total number of
               features by 15\% (a reduction in noise features) while
               increasing the number of true metabolites detected and grouped
               by 20\%. Our credentialing platform relies on easily generated
               E. coli samples and a simple software algorithm that is freely

  abstract = "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was the first animal to have
              its genome fully sequenced and has become an important model
              organism for biomedical research. However, like many other animal
              model systems, its metabolome remained largely uncharacterized,
              until recent investigations demonstrated the importance of small
              molecule-based signalling cascades for virtually every aspect of
              nematode biology. These studies have revealed that nematodes are
              amazingly skilled chemists: using simple building blocks from
              conserved primary metabolism and a strategy of modular assembly,
              C. elegans and other nematode species create complex molecular
              architectures to regulate their development and behaviour. These
              nematode-derived modular metabolites (NDMMs) are based on the
              dideoxysugars ascarylose or paratose, which serve as scaffolds
              for attachment of moieties from lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate,
              citrate, and nucleoside metabolism. Mutant screens and
              comparative metabolomics based on NMR spectroscopy and MS have
              so-far revealed several 100 different ascarylose
              (``ascarosides'') and a few paratose (``paratosides'')
              derivatives, many of which represent potent signalling molecules
              that can be active at femtomolar levels, regulating development,
              behaviour, body shape, and many other life history traits. NDMM
              biosynthesis appears to be carefully regulated as assembly of
              different modules proceeds with very high specificity.
              Preliminary biosynthetic studies have confirmed the primary
              metabolism origin of some NDMM building blocks, whereas the
              mechanisms that underlie their highly specific assembly are not
              understood. Considering their functions and biosynthetic origin,
              NDMMs represent a new class of natural products that cannot
              easily be classified as ``primary'' or ``secondary''. We believe
              that the identification of new variants of primary
              metabolism-derived structures that serve important signalling
              functions in C. elegans and other nematodes provides a strong
              incentive for a comprehensive re-analysis of metabolism in higher

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Multicellular organisms have evolved
               systems/mechanisms to detect various forms of danger, including
               attack by microbial pathogens and a variety of pests, as well as
               tissue and cellular damage. Detection via cell-surface receptors
               activates an ancient and evolutionarily conserved innate immune
               system. RESULT: Potentially harmful microorganisms are
               recognized by the presence of molecules or parts of molecules
               that have structures or chemical patterns unique to microbes and
               thus are perceived as non-self/foreign. They are referred to as
               Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns (MAMPs). Recently, a class
               of small molecules that is made only by nematodes, and that
               functions as pheromones in these organisms, was shown to be
               recognized by a wide range of plants. In the presence of these
               molecules, termed Nematode-Associated Molecular Patterns
               (NAMPs), plants activate innate immune responses and display
               enhanced resistance to a broad spectrum of microbial and
               nematode pathogens. In addition to pathogen attack, the
               relocation of various endogenous molecules or parts of
               molecules, generally to the extracellular milieu, as a result of
               tissue or cellular damage is perceived as a danger signal, and
               it leads to the induction of innate immune responses. These
               relocated endogenous inducers are called Damage-Associated

  abstract  = "In the past two decades, significant progress has been made in
               the sequencing, assembly, annotation and analyses of genomes and
               transcriptomes of parasitic worms of socioeconomic importance.
               This progress has somewhat improved our knowledge and
               understanding of these pathogens at the molecular level.
               However, compared with the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis
               elegans, the areas of functional genomics, transcriptomics,
               proteomics and metabolomics of parasitic nematodes are still in
               their infancy, and there are major gaps in our knowledge and
               understanding of the molecular biology of parasitic nematodes.
               The information on signalling molecules, molecular pathways and
               microRNAs (miRNAs) that are known to be involved in
               developmental processes in C. elegans and the availability of
               some molecular resources (draft genomes, transcriptomes and some
               proteomes) for selected parasitic nematodes provide a basis to
               start exploring the developmental biology of parasitic
               nematodes. Indeed, some studies have identified molecules and
               pathways that might associate with developmental processes in
               related, parasitic nematodes, such as Haemonchus contortus
               (barber's pole worm). However, detailed information is often
               scant and 'omics resources are limited, preventing a proper
               integration of 'omic data sets and comprehensive analyses.
               Moreover, little is known about the functional roles of
               pheromones, hormones, signalling pathways and
               post-transcriptional/post-translational regulations in the
               development of key parasitic nematodes throughout their entire
               life cycles. Although C. elegans is an excellent model to assist
               molecular studies of parasitic nematodes, its use is limited
               when it comes to explorations of processes that are specific to
               parasitism within host animals. A deep understanding of
               parasitic nematodes, such as H. contortus, requires
               substantially enhanced resources and the use of integrative
               'omics approaches for analyses. The improved genome and
               well-established in vitro larval culture system for H. contortus
               provide unprecedented opportunities for comprehensive studies of
               the transcriptomes (mRNA and miRNA), proteomes (somatic,
               excretory/secretory and phosphorylated proteins) and lipidomes
               (e.g., polar and neutral lipids) of this nematode. Such
               resources should enable in-depth explorations of its
               developmental biology at a level, not previously possible. The
               main aims of this review are (i) to provide a background on the
               development of nematodes, with a particular emphasis on the
               molecular aspects involved in the dauer formation and exit in C.
               elegans; (ii) to critically appraise the current state of
               knowledge of the developmental biology of parasitic nematodes
               and identify key knowledge gaps; (iii) to cover salient aspects
               of H. contortus, with a focus on the recent advances in
               genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and lipidomics as well as
               in vitro culturing systems; (iv) to review recent advances in
               our knowledge and understanding of the molecular and
               developmental biology of H. contortus using an integrative
               multiomics approach, and discuss the implications of this
               approach for detailed explorations of signalling molecules,
               molecular processes and pathways likely associated with nematode
               development, adaptation and parasitism, and for the
               identification of novel intervention targets against these
               pathogens. Clearly, the multiomics approach established recently
               is readily applicable to exploring a wide range of interesting
               and socioeconomically significant parasitic worms (including
               also trematodes and cestodes) at the molecular level, and to

               ``end game''. Efforts toward the identification of suitable
               biomarkers have focused on specific protein(s) and/or nucleic
               acids, but metabolites present an alternative option as they
               have limited half-lives and are the result of combinatorial
               effects. In comparison to previously used methodology of LC-MS
               for metabolomic approaches, we used a non-targeted capillary
               electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) to
               analyze the serum metabolic profiles of Ov-infected and
               -uninfected individuals (n=20). We identified 286 known
               metabolites (167 in the cation mode and 119 in the anion mode).
               In addition, putative metabolites were identified based on KEGG
               (51), HMDB (37) and HMT (6) databases. One hundred ten of these
               putative metabolites were quantified based on peak areas of
               internal standards and their ability to be mapped to known
               pathways (primary-, carbon-, lipid-, amino acid-, nucleotide and
               coenzyme-metabolism). Multivariate analysis demonstrated
               clustering and segregation of some of these metabolites to
               either the infected or control groups. The levels of serotonin,
               hypoxanthine, pipecolic acid and inosine were significantly
               elevated in those with onchocerciasis, whereas the levels of
               glycerophosphocholine, choline and adenine were significantly

               view of the metabolic variations that occur during Ov infection
               and thus allow the discovery of key metabolites (and associated

               activity of UGTs in abamectin-resistant (AbR) strain was
               significantly higher (2.35-fold) than that in susceptible strain

               effect of abamectin on mites. From the previous microarray
               results, we found an UGT gene (UGT201D3) overexpressed in AbR

               $\alpha$-naphthol activity (2.81 $\pm$ 0.43 nmol/mg

               veterinary importance represents a serious welfare and economic
               problem for the livestock production industry. Research into the
               mechanisms by which parasites develop resistance is necessary to
               prolong the life of the available drugs and to minimise
               development of resistance to new classes. Metabolism of
               anthelmintic compounds by parasites is a possible mechanism of
               resistance that has received little research, despite there
               being precedence in the case of insecticide resistance. Due to
               the more advanced molecular tools available and comparative ease
               of manipulation; we have used the model nematode Caenorhabditis
               elegans to investigate the metabolism of two important
               anthelmintic drugs, ivermectin and albendazole. Whole genome
               microarrays and RT-QPCR were used to identify clusters of genes,
               which are significantly up-regulated upon exposure of C. elegans
               to anthelmintic. The transcriptomic response to albendazole is
               characterised by genes potentially involved in xenobiotic
               metabolism. These include members of the cytochrome P450 family
               and the UDP-glucuronosyl/ glucosyl transferase family. In
               contrast, the response to ivermectin appears to represent a
               fasting response caused by the phenotype of drug exposed
               nematodes. Recombinant worms carrying GFP reporter constructs of
               several genes of interest demonstrated their expression in the
               intestine, which is thought to be the main site of xenobiotic
               detoxification in nematodes. HPLC-MS techniques have
               definitively shown that C. elegans is able to metabolise
               albendazole to two glucose conjugates. These metabolites are
               compatible with the transcriptomic response to the drug and are
               similar to albendazole metabolites produced by the parasitic
               nematode Haemonchus contortus. No ivermectin metabolites were
               identified in the current study. The data presented confirms the
               ability of the nematode C. elegans to respond to and metabolise
               anthelmintic compounds. In addition, the study validates the use
               of C. elegans as a model organism for parasitic nematodes and
               provides a platform upon which to investigate nematode
               metabolism further.",

              branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex,
              a core component of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism.
              We causally linked a non-synonymous variant in the conserved
              lipoyl domain of DBT-1 to differential arsenic responses. Using
              targeted metabolomics and chemical supplementation, we
              demonstrate that differences in responses to arsenic are caused
              by variation in iso-branched chain fatty acids. Additionally, we
              show that levels of branched chain fatty acids in human cells are
              perturbed by arsenic treatment. This finding has broad

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Over the past 20 years, advances in genomic
              technology have enabled unparalleled access to the information
              contained within the human genome. However, the multiple genetic
              variants associated with various diseases typically account for
              only a small fraction of the disease risk. This may be due to the
              multifactorial nature of disease mechanisms, the strong impact of
              the environment, and the complexity of gene-environment
              interactions. Metabolomics is the quantification of small
              molecules produced by metabolic processes within a biological
              sample. Metabolomics datasets contain a wealth of information
              that reflect the disease state and are consequent to both genetic
              variation and environment. Thus, metabolomics is being widely
              adopted for epidemiologic research to identify disease risk
              traits. In this review, we discuss the evolution and challenges
              of metabolomics in epidemiologic research, particularly for
              assessing environmental exposures and providing insights into
              gene-environment interactions, and mechanism of biological
              impact. MAIN TEXT: Metabolomics can be used to measure the
              complex global modulating effect that an exposure event has on an
              individual phenotype. Combining information derived from all
              levels of protein synthesis and subsequent enzymatic action on
              metabolite production can reveal the individual exposotype. We
              discuss some of the methodological and statistical challenges in
              dealing with this type of high-dimensional data, such as the
              impact of study design, analytical biases, and biological
              variance. We show examples of disease risk inference from
              metabolic traits using metabolome-wide association studies. We
              also evaluate how these studies may drive precision medicine
              approaches, and pharmacogenomics, which have up to now been
              inefficient. Finally, we discuss how to promote transparency and
              open science to improve reproducibility and credibility in
              metabolomics. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of exposotypes at the human
              population level may help understanding how environmental
              exposures affect biology at the systems level to determine cause,
              effect, and susceptibilities. Juxtaposition and integration of
              genomics and metabolomics information may offer additional
              insights. Clinical utility of this information for single
              individuals and populations has yet to be routinely demonstrated,
              but hopefully, recent advances to improve the robustness of
              large-scale metabolomics will facilitate clinical translation.",

  abstract = "Parasitic helminths cause significant disease in animals and
              humans. In the absence of alternative treatments, anthelmintics
              remain the principal agents for their control. Resistance extends
              to the most important class of anthelmintics, the macrocyclic
              lactone endectocides (MLs), such as ivermectin, and presents
              serious problems for the livestock industries and threatens to
              severely limit current parasite control strategies in humans.
              Understanding drug resistance is important for optimizing and
              monitoring control, and reducing further selection for
              resistance. Multidrug resistance (MDR) ABC transporters have been
              implicated in ML resistance and contribute to resistance to a
              number of other anthelmintics. MDR transporters, such as
              P-glycoproteins, are essential for many cellular processes that
              require the transport of substrates across cell membranes. Being
              overexpressed in response to chemotherapy in tumour cells and to
              ML-based treatment in nematodes, they lead to therapy failure by
              decreasing drug concentration at the target. Several
              anthelmintics are inhibitors of these efflux pumps and
              appropriate combinations can result in higher treatment efficacy
              against parasites and reversal of resistance. However, this needs
              to be balanced against possible increased toxicity to the host,
              or the components of the combination selecting on the same genes
              involved in the resistance. Increased efficacy could result from
              modifying anthelmintic pharmacokinetics in the host or by
              blocking parasite transporters involved in resistance.
              Combination of anthelmintics can be beneficial for delaying
              selection for resistance. However, it should be based on
              knowledge of resistance mechanisms and not simply on mode of
              action classes, and is best started before resistance has been
              selected to any member of the combination. Increasing knowledge
              of the MDR transporters involved in anthelmintic resistance in
              helminths will play an important role in allowing for the
              identification of markers to monitor the spread of resistance and
              to evaluate new tools and management practices aimed at delaying
              its spread.",

              alterations in S. mansoni PZQ-resistant adult worms and eggs, by
              comparing a PZQ- resistant strain obtained under PZQ drug
              pressure with a PZQ-susceptible strain. For this, scanning
              electronic microscopy was used to assess tegumental
              responsiveness of both strains under PZQ exposure, and optical
              microscopy allowed the monitoring of worms and eggs in the
              presence of the drug. Those assays showed that PZQ-susceptible
              worms exposed to the drug had more severe tegumental damages than
              the resistant one, which had only minor alterations. Moreover,
              contrary to what occurred in the susceptible strain, resistant
              worms were viable after PZQ exposure and gradually regaining full
              motility after removal of the drug. Eggs from resistant strain
              parasites are considerably smaller than those from susceptible
              strain. Our results suggest that there might be a difference in
              the tegument composition of the resistant strain and that worms
              are less responsive to PZQ. Changes observed in egg morphology
              might imply alterations in the biology of schistosomes associated
              to PZQ-resistance, which could impact on transmission and
              pathology of the disease. Moreover, we propose a hypothetical
              scenario where there is a different egg tropism of the S. mansoni
              resistant strain. This study is the first comparing two strains
              that only differ in their resistance characteristics, which makes

               poorly understood for many commonly used drugs with most
               research being focused on mechanisms involving drug targets or
               drug efflux. Altered or increased drug metabolism is a possible

               clear role of xenobiotic metabolism in pesticide resistance in
               insects. The cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are a large family of
               drug-metabolising enzymes present in almost all living
               organisms, but for many years thought to be absent from
               parasitic nematodes. In this paper, we describe the CYP
               sequences encoded in the H. contortus genome and compare their
               expression in different parasite life-stages, sexes and tissues.
               We developed a novel real-time PCR approach based on partially
               assembled CYP sequences ``tags'' and confirmed findings in the
               subsequent draft genome with RNA-seq. Constitutive expression

               CYP subfamily expansions seen in C. elegans and other species,
               which are typical of CYPs with exogenous roles. However, a small

               anthelmintics are the mainstay in the treatment of haemonchosis,
               their efficacy diminishes due to drug-resistance development in
               H. contortus. An increased anthelmintics inactivation via
               biotransformation belongs to a significant drug-resistance
               mechanism in H. contortus. UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs)
               participate in the metabolic inactivation of anthelmintics and
               other xenobiotic substrates through their conjugation with
               activated sugar, which drives the elimination of the xenobiotics
               due to enhanced solubility. The UGTs family, in terms of the
               biotransformation of commonly used anthelmintics, has been well
               described in adults as a target stage. In contrast, the
               free-living juvenile stages of H. contortus have attracted less

               the life cycle of the juvenile nematodes, suggesting their
               different roles. Furthermore, the constitutive expression in a
               susceptible strain with two resistant strains shows several
               resistance-related changes in UGTs expression, and the exposure
               of juvenile stages of H. contortus to albendazole (ABZ) and
               ABZ-sulfoxide (ABZSO; in sublethal concentrations) leads to the

  abstract  = "Malaria continues to be an enormous global health challenge,
               with millions of new infections and deaths reported annually.
               This is partly due to the development of resistance by the
               malaria parasite to the majority of established anti-malarial
               drugs, a situation that continues to hamper attempts at
               controlling the disease. This has spurred intensive drug
               discovery endeavours geared towards identifying novel, highly
               active anti-malarial drugs, and the identification of quality
               leads from natural sources would greatly augment these efforts.
               The current reality is that other than compounds that have their
               foundation in historic natural products, there are no other
               compounds in drug discovery as part of lead optimization
               projects and preclinical development or further that have
               originated from a natural product start-point in recent years.
               This paper briefly presents both classical as well as some more
               modern, but underutilized, approaches that have been applied
               outside the field of malaria, and which could be considered in

               parasitology have been multi-faceted. Traditional uses of
               spectroscopic platforms focused on determining the chemical
               composition of drugs or natural products used for treatment of
               parasitic infection. A natural progression of the use of these
               tools led to the generation of chemical profiles of the parasite
               in in vitro systems, monitoring the response of the parasite to
               chemotherapeutics, profiling metabolic consequences in the host

              emerge, thus, new therapeutic targets and agents are desperately
              needed to treat and cure this devastating disease. Chitin
              metabolism plays a central role in invertebrate biology due to
              the critical structural function of chitin for the organism.
              Taken together with its absence in mammals, targeting chitin is
              an appealing therapeutic avenue. Importantly, the chitinase
              OvCHT1 from O. volvulus was recently discovered, however, its
              exact role in the worm's metabolism remains unknown. A screening
              effort against OvCHT1 was conducted using the Johns Hopkins
              Clinical Compound Library that contains over 1,500 existing
              drugs. Closantel, a veterinary anthelmintic with known proton

               The study justified the need for alternative anthelmintics. The

               mitochondrial activity, alter cell membrane permeability,
               vacuolation and membrane damage. Benzyl isothiocyanate
               glucosinolates interfere with DNA replication and protein
               expression, while isoflavones from Acacia oxyphylla cause
               helminth flaccid paralysis, inhibit energy generation, and

               cause the death of nematodes and paralysis leading to expulsion
               from the gastro-intestinal tract. Flavonoids from Chenopodium
               album L and Mangifera indica L act through the action of
               phosphodiesterase and Ca2+-ATPase, and flavonoids and tannins

               praziquantel. Artemisinins from Artemisia cina O. Berg are known

              reliable approach to identify unknown compounds. A factor

              strain selection before data collection, thus established and
              hypothesized pathways can put unknown spectral features into
              context and help narrow possibilities during compound

              identification of molecular targets of all major anthelmintic
              drug classes. Here, we used genetically diverse C. elegans
              strains to perform dose-response analyses across 26 anthelmintic
              drugs that represent the three major anthelmintic drug classes
              (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones, and nicotinic
              acetylcholine receptor agonists) in addition to seven other
              anthelmintic classes. First, we found that C. elegans strains
              displayed similar anthelmintic responses within drug classes and
              significant variation across drug classes. Next, we compared the
              effective concentration estimates to induce a 10\% maximal
              response (EC10) and slope estimates of each dose-response curve

              elegans is a useful model for screening potential nematicides
              before applications to helminths. Third, we quantified the levels
              of anthelmintic response variation caused by genetic differences
              among individuals (heritability) to each drug and observed a
              significant correlation between exposure closest to the EC10 and
              the exposure that exhibited the most heritable responses. These

               parasite or differ in their structural features from those of
               the homologous counterpart present in the vertebrate host. The
               benzimidazoles exert their effect by binding selectively and
               with high affinity to the beta-subunit of helminth microtubule
               protein. The target site of the nicotinic agonists (e.g.
               levamisole, tetrahydropyrimidines) is a pharmacologically
               distinct nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channel in nematodes.
               The macrocyclic lactones (e.g. ivermectin, moxidectin) act as
               agonists of a family of invertebrate-specific inhibitory

              depolarization was seen with coapplication of maximal glutamate
              during the maximal ivermectin response, indicating that
              ivermectin depolarizes the muscle by the same ionic mechanism as
              glutamate (i.e., chloride). The potency of ivermectin on the
              pharynx was greater than at any of the GluCl subunits expressed
              in X. laevis oocytes. This effect of ivermectin was abolished in
              the mutant avr-15, which lacks a functional GluCl-alpha2 subunit.
              However, a chloride-dependent, nondesensitizing response to
              glutamate persisted. Therefore, the GluCl-alpha2 subunit confers
              ivermectin sensitivity and a high-affinity desensitizing
              glutamate response on the native pharyngeal GluCl receptor.",

              only a small fraction of the variation in their finite
              replicative capacity is explained by the chronological age of the
              donor. Because we had previously shown that telomeres, the
              terminal guanine-rich sequences of chromosomes, shorten
              throughout the life-span of cultured cells, we wished to
              determine whether variation in initial telomere length would
              account for the unexplained variation in replicative capacity.
              Analysis of cells from 31 donors (aged 0-93 yr) indicated
              relatively weak correlations between proliferative ability and
              donor age (m = -0.2 doubling per yr; r = -0.42; P = 0.02) and
              between telomeric DNA and donor age (m = -15 base pairs per yr; r
              = -0.43; P = 0.02). However, there was a striking correlation,
              valid over the entire age range of the donors, between
              replicative capacity and initial telomere length (m = 10
              doublings per kilobase pair; r = 0.76; P = 0.004), indicating
              that cell strains with shorter telomeres underwent significantly
              fewer doublings than those with longer telomeres. These
              observations suggest that telomere length is a biomarker of
              somatic cell aging in humans and are consistent with a causal
              role for telomere loss in this process. We also found that
              fibroblasts from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria donors had short
              telomeres, consistent with their reduced division potential in
              vitro. In contrast, telomeres from sperm DNA did not decrease
              with age of the donor, suggesting that a mechanism for
              maintaining telomere length, such as telomerase expression, may

              activity. Compared with data from young mice, young MRs have 1.6

              found in grapes and red wine, increases metabolic rate, insulin
              sensitivity, mitochondrial biogenesis, and physical endurance and
              reduces fat accumulation in mice. Although it is thought that
              resveratrol targets Sirt1, this is controversial because
              resveratrol also activates 5' AMP-activated protein kinase
              (AMPK), which also regulates insulin sensitivity and
              mitochondrial biogenesis. Here, we use mice deficient in
              AMPKalpha1 or -alpha2 to determine whether the metabolic effects
              of resveratrol are mediated by AMPK. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
              Mice deficient in the catalytic subunit of AMPK (alpha1 or
              alpha2) and wild-type mice were fed a high-fat diet or high-fat
              diet supplemented with resveratrol for 13 weeks. Body weight was
              recorded biweekly and metabolic parameters were measured. We also
              used mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in AMPK to study the
              role of AMPK in resveratrol-mediated effects in vitro. RESULTS:
              Resveratrol increased the metabolic rate and reduced fat mass in
              wild-type mice but not in AMPKalpha1(-/-) mice. In the absence of
              either AMPKalpha1 or -alpha2, resveratrol failed to increase
              insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, mitochondrial biogenesis,
              and physical endurance. Consistent with this, the expression of
              genes important for mitochondrial biogenesis was not induced by
              resveratrol in AMPK-deficient mice. In addition, resveratrol
              increased the NAD-to-NADH ratio in an AMPK-dependent manner,
              which may explain how resveratrol may activate Sirt1 indirectly.
              CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that AMPK, which was thought to be an
              off-target hit of resveratrol, is the central target for the

              expression are associated with resistance to several different

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A central premise of physiological ecology is that an
              animal's preferred body temperature should correspond closely
              with the temperature maximizing performance and Darwinian
              fitness. Testing this co-adaptational hypothesis has been
              problematic for several reasons. First, reproductive fitness is
              the appropriate measure, but is difficult to measure in most
              animals. Second, no single fitness measure applies to all
              demographic situations, complicating interpretations. Here we
              test the co-adaptation hypothesis by studying an organism
              (Caenorhabditis elegans) in which both fitness and thermal
              preference can be reliably measured. RESULTS: We find that
              natural isolates of C. elegans display a range of mean thermal
              preferences and also vary in their thermal sensitivities for
              fitness. Hot-seeking isolates CB4854 and CB4857 prefer
              temperatures that favor population growth rate (r), whereas the
              cold-seeking isolate CB4856 prefers temperatures that favor

              between fitness and thermal preference in natural isolates of C.
              elegans are driven primarily by isolate-specific differences in
              thermal preference. If these differences are the result of
              natural selection, then this suggests that the appropriate
              measure of fitness for use in evolutionary ecology studies might

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In the last few years stud farms have experienced
               increasing problems with Parascaris equorum infections in foals
               despite intensive deworming programs. This has led to the
               question as to whether the anthelmintic drugs used against this
               parasite are failing. This study aimed to investigate the
               efficacy of ivermectin, fenbendazole and pyrantel on the faecal
               output of ascarid eggs of foals. METHODS: A Faecal Egg Count
               Reduction Test (FECRT) was performed on nine large studs in
               Sweden. Anthelmintic drugs were given orally and faecal samples
               were examined for ascarid eggs on the day of deworming and 14
               days later. Faecal Egg Count Reductions (FECRs) were calculated
               on arithmetic means of transformed individual FECRs and on
               arithmetic means of individual FECRs. RESULTS: Seventy-nine
               (48\%) out of a total of 165 foals sampled were positive for P.
               equorum eggs before deworming and 66 of these met the criteria
               for being used in the efficacy assessment. It was shown that
               there was no, or very low activity of ivermectin on the output
               of ascarid eggs in the majority of the foals, whereas for
               fenbendazole and pyrantel it was >90\%. CONCLUSION: Ivermectin
               resistance was shown in 5 out of 6 farms. Therefore, ivermectin
               should not be the drug of choice in the control of P. equorum
               infections in foals. According to the results of this study,
               fenbendazole or pyrantel are still effective and should be used
               against this parasite.",

               recommended dose (13.2 mg/ kg) when tapeworm eggs were also

               75\%) in Parascaris egg counts was seen 2 weeks after ivermectin

              especially of small ruminants, but our understanding of it has
              been limited by the difficulty in carrying out functional genetic
              studies on parasitic nematodes. An important nematode infecting
              sheep and goats is Haemonchus contortus; in many parts of the
              world this species is resistant to almost all the currently
              available drugs, including ivermectin. It is extremely
              polymorphic and to date it has proved impossible to relate any
              sequence polymorphisms to its ivermectin resistance status.
              Expression of candidate drug-resistance genes in Caenorhabditis
              elegans could provide a convenient means to study the effects of
              polymorphisms found in resistant parasites, but may be
              complicated by differences between the gene families of target
              and model organisms. We tested this using the glutamate-gated
              chloride channel (GluCl) gene family, which forms the ivermectin
              drug target and are candidate resistance genes. We expressed
              GluCl subunits from C. elegans and H. contortus in a highly
              resistant triple mutant C. elegans strain (DA1316) under the
              control of the avr-14 promoter; expression of GFP behind this
              promoter recapitulated the pattern previously reported for
              avr-14. Expression of ivermectin-sensitive subunits from both
              species restored drug sensitivity to transgenic worms, though
              some quantitative differences were noted between lines.
              Expression of an ivermectin-insensitive subunit, Hco-GLC-2, had
              no effect on drug sensitivity. Expression of a previously
              uncharacterised parasite-specific subunit, Hco-GLC-6, caused the
              transgenic worms to become ivermectin sensitive, suggesting that
              this subunit also encodes a GluCl that responds to the drug.
              These results demonstrate that both orthologous and paralogous
              subunits from C. elegans and H. contortus are able to rescue the
              ivermectin sensitivity of mutant C. elegans, though some
              quantitative differences were observed between transgenic lines
              in some assays. C. elegans is a suitable system for studying

              sheep in New Zealand indicated that the magnitude of the problem
              has increased from very low levels only a few years ago to
              disturbingly high levels now. There is a particular problem with
              multiple resistance to all three action families of anthelmintic
              currently available in Ostertagia (= Teladorsagia) spp in sheep,
              and to both macrocyclic lactones (ML) and benzimidazoles in
              Cooperia spp in cattle. The prevalence and extent of resistance
              indicate that all cattle farmers and most sheep farmers should
              now be using a combination anthelmintic on most occasions just to
              achieve effective control of all parasites. Despite this, the
              presence of resistant parasites has generally not been
              appreciated by the majority of affected farmers, possibly because
              most have not formally tested to determine the resistance status
              of nematodes on their farms. Anthelmintics will remain the
              cornerstone of gastrointestinal nematode control in sheep and
              cattle for the foreseeable future but to ensure their continued
              effectiveness farmers need to be constantly aware of the need to
              maintain adequate reservoirs of unselected nematodes, i.e. worms
              in refugia, to minimise the expansion of the resistant
              population. High-risk practices in relation to selection of
              resistance need to be identified and avoided or at least their
              use limited. These include: treating adult animals where there is
              no identified need, moving newly treated animals onto 'clean'
              pasture, and failing to effectively quarantine-drench bought-in
              animals. None of these are new concepts but many have not been
              adopted or practised. In particular, sheep farmers should
              endeavour to avoid treating ewes pre-lambing with long-acting
              anthelmintics. Farmers needs to negotiate a balance between
              achieving good parasite control and the sustainability of their

              metabolites). In contrast to herbicide target site mutations,
              fewer non-target mechanisms have been elucidated at the molecular
              level because of the inherently complicated biochemical processes
              and the limited genomic information available for weedy species.

              ban on conventional battery cages. As infection is associated
              with slow development of low levels of acquired protective
              immunity, parasite control relies on repeated use of dewormers
              (anthelmintics). Benzimidazoles (BZ) are currently the only
              anthelmintic registered in the EU for use in controlling A. galli
              and there is an obvious risk of overuse of one drug class,
              selecting for resistance. Thus we developed a reference
              transcriptome of A. galli to investigate the response in gene
              expression before and after exposure to the BZ drug flubendazole
              (FLBZ). Transcriptional variations between treated and untreated
              A. galli showed that transcripts annotated as mitochondrial
              glutamate dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 were significantly

  author   = "de Lourdes Mottier, Maria and Prichard, Roger K",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: We have found that in a laboratory strain of the
              nematode parasite of ruminants, Haemonchus contortus, repeated
              ivermectin treatment, in vivo in sheep, selected against TTC,
              coding for Phe, and for TAC, coding for Tyr, at codon 200 in
              beta-tubulin isotype 1. This 200Tyr single nucleotide
              polymorphism (SNP) has been associated with benzimidazole
              anthelmintic resistance. In this study, we investigated the
              alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin sequences of 17 different field
              and laboratory strains/isolates of H. contortus with known
              treatment history and status for susceptibility or resistance to
              macrocyclic lactone (ML) or benzimidazole anthelmintics. BASIC
              METHODS: DNA (genomic or cDNA) from 10 to 32 male parasites was
              sequenced for alpha-tubulin or beta-tubulin for each
              strain/isolate and the frequency of coding SNPs was compared
              between the different strains/isolates with known treatment
              history and drug resistance status. MAIN RESULTS: We have
              analyzed alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin isotypes 1 and 2 genes
              from the different H. contortus strains/isolates and found that
              repeated ivermectin or moxidectin (both ML anthelmintics) use
              changes the frequency of beta-tubulin isotype 1 alleles and
              selects for the following SNPs: either from TTC (Phe) to TAC
              (Tyr) at codon 200 or codon 167, or from GCA (Ala) to GAA (Glu)
              at codon 198. 200Tyr and 167Tyr were associated with GTT (Val) or
              CTC/CTT (Leu) at codon 368, whereas 200Phe or 167Phe were
              associated with either ATT (Ile) or GTT (Val) at codon 368 in
              beta-tubulin isotype 1. The SNPs 200Tyr, 167Tyr in beta-tubulin
              isotype 1 have been described to confer benzimidazole resistance
              in nematodes and recently 198Ala has also been associated with
              benzimidazole resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Although MLs exert their
              antiparasitic effect through binding to ligand-gated chloride
              channels, benzimidazoles interact with beta-tubulin. These
              genetic analyses indicate that there is a correlation between
              exposure and/or resistance to MLs and an increase in the
              frequency of the beta-tubulin alleles containing codons, which
              are determinant for benzimidazole resistance. ML use may
              predispose parasitic nematodes to benzimidazole resistance. This
              has major implications for parasite control programs dependent on
              MLs/benzimidazole rotations and on the use of ML/benzimidazole
              combination therapy, such as for human lymphatic filariasis and
              nematode control in ruminant livestock.",

  abstract = "The anthelmintic invermectin has a number of effects on nematodes
              which result in changes in behaviour, particularly locomotion,
              including paralysis and an inhibition of feeding. This paper
              describes the application of an in vitro pharmacological approach
              to further delineate the action of ivermectin on feeding
              behaviour. Contraction of Ascaris suum pharyngeal muscle was
              monitored using a modified pressure transducer system which
              detects changes in intrapharyngeal pressure and therefore
              contraction of the radial muscle of the pharynx. The pharynx did
              not contract spontaneously. However, serotonin (5-HT, 100 microM)
              stimulated rhythmic contractions and relaxations (pumping) at a
              frequency of 0.5 Hz. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamic
              acid inhibited the pumping elicited by 5-HT. The duration of
              inhibition was concentration dependent (1-1000 microM) with a
              threshold of 1 microM and 10 microM respectively (n = 8).
              Ivermectin also inhibited pharyngeal pumping (1-1000 nM). At
              lower concentrations, ivermectin (1-10 pM) potentiated the GABA
              and glutamate inhibition, so that inhibition occurred at
              concentrations which were below threshold in the absence of
              ivermectin. These data provide evidence that the pharynx is a
              site for the action of ivermectin. Thus interruption of
              pharyngeal processes such as, feeding, regulation of hydrostatic
              pressure and secretion may provide a new site of anthelmintic
              action.",

              macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics is an emerging problem in the
              south-east of Scotland. The general management and nematode
              control strategies employed in four affected flocks (flocks 1-4)
              were investigated in an attempt to identify the risk factors
              which might have led to the appearance of production limiting
              disease associated with anthelmintic resistance. The important
              risk factors for multiple anthelmintic resistance could not be
              confirmed and it proved easier to criticise nematode control
              practices on theoretical grounds, than to propose practical
              solutions. It seems likely that different risk factors were
              involved in the four flocks. Lambs in flocks 1 and 2 had been
              treated with an anthelmintic at 3-4 weekly intervals with the aim
              of achieving suppressive nematode control, while sheep in flock 1
              had been treated with an anthelmintic after they were moved onto
              clean grazing. Recently lambed ewes had been treated with
              moxidectin in three of the four flocks, with the aim of
              controlling their periparturient rise in faecal nematode egg
              output. All of these factors might have contributed to the
              emergence of multiple anthelmintic resistance, because they could
              have led to anthelmintic treatments at times when the nematode
              population in refugia was small, compared to that in the sheep.
              Annual rotation of the anthelmintic group was compromised by the
              emergence of benzimidazole resistance and did not prevent the
              emergence of multiple resistance in any of the flocks described,
              although the practice may have slowed the development of
              resistance. Underdosing may have selected for benzimidazole and
              imidazothiazole resistance in flock 2, associated with inaccurate
              estimation of the weights of terminal sire lambs. These
              investigations also highlighted problems associated with the
              diagnosis of anthelmintic resistance, in particular the
              confounding effects of the onset of host immunity to nematode
              parasites, the possible influence of the age of the adult

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ivermectin has been used for onchocerciasis control
              since 1987. Because of the long-term use of this drug and the
              development of resistance in other nematodes, we have assessed
              Onchocerca volvulus burdens, effectiveness of ivermectin as a
              microfilaricide, and its effect on adult female worm
              reproduction. METHODS: For the first phase of the study, 2501
              individuals in Ghana, from 19 endemic communities who had
              received six to 18 annual rounds of ivermectin and one ivermectin
              naive community, were assessed for microfilarial loads 7 days
              before the 2004 yearly ivermectin treatment, by means of skin
              snips, and 30 days after treatment to assess the ivermectin
              microfilaricidal action. For the second phase, skin snips were
              taken from 342 individuals from ten communities, who were
              microfilaria positive at pretreatment assessment, on days 90 and
              180 after treatment, to identify the effects of ivermectin on
              female worm fertility, assessed by microfilaria repopulation.
              FINDINGS: 487 (19\%) of the 2501 participants were microfilaria
              positive. The microfilaria prevalence and community microfilarial
              load in treated communities ranged from 2.2\% to 51.8\%, and 0.06
              microfilariae per snip to 2.85 microfilariae per snip,
              respectively. Despite treatment, the prevalence rate doubled
              between 2000 and 2005 in two communities. Microfilaria assessment
              30 days after ivermectin treatment showed 100\% clearance of
              microfilaria in more than 99\% of people. At day 90 after
              treatment, four of ten communities had significant microfilaria
              repopulation, from 7.1\% to 21.1\% of pretreatment counts, rising
              to 53.9\% by day 180. INTERPRETATION: Ivermectin remains a potent
              microfilaricide. However, our results suggest that resistant
              adult parasite populations, which are not responding as expected
              to ivermectin, are emerging. A high rate of repopulation of skin
              with microfilariae will allow parasite transmission, possibly
              with ivermectin-resistant O volvulus, which could eventually lead
              to recrudescence of the disease.",

              worms was inferred from the high level of microfilaridermia

              confirm the existence of populations of adult female O. volvulus

              are an enzyme superfamily that catalyzes glycosyl residues
              transfer from activated nucleotide sugars to acceptor molecules.
              In addition to various endogenous compounds, numerous xenobiotics
              are substrates of UGTs. As the glycosides formed are generally
              less active/toxic and more hydrophilic than aglycones, UGTs
              effectively protect organisms from potentially harmful
              xenobiotics. Therefore, increased UGT expression and/or activity
              improve the protection of the organism and may contribute to the
              development of individuals that become more resistant to certain
              xenobiotics. While the function of UGTs in the resistance of
              human cancer cells to chemotherapy is now well known, other
              organisms and other xenobiotics have attracted much less
              attention. This review was designed to fill this knowledge gap by
              presenting complex information about the role of UGTs in
              xenobiotic-resistance in various organisms. This summarization
              and evaluation of the available information reveals that UGTs
              play an important role in defense against xenobiotics not only in
              humans, but in countless other organisms such as parasites,
              insects, and plants. Moreover, many recent studies clearly show
              the participation of UGTs in the resistance of nematodes to
              anthelmintics, insects to insecticides, weeds to herbicides as
              well as humans to various drugs (not only those used in cancer
              therapy but also in the treatment of epilepsy, psychiatric
              disorders, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and HIV
              infection). Nevertheless, although the contribution of UGTs to
              xenobiotic resistance in diverse organisms has become obvious,
              many pieces of information remain missing, for example with
              regard to the mechanisms of UGT regulation.",

  abstract = "In an ageing society, polypharmacy has become a major public
              health and economic issue. Overuse of medications, especially in
              patients with chronic diseases, carries major health risks. One
              common consequence of polypharmacy is the increased emergence of
              adverse drug events, mainly from drug-drug interactions. The
              majority of currently available drugs are metabolized by CYP450
              enzymes. Interactions due to shared CYP450-mediated metabolic
              pathways for two or more drugs are frequent, especially through
              reversible or irreversible CYP450 inhibition. The magnitude of
              these interactions depends on several factors, including varying
              affinity and concentration of substrates, time delay between the
              administration of the drugs, and mechanisms of CYP450 inhibition.
              Various types of CYP450 inhibition (competitive, non-competitive,
              mechanism-based) have been observed clinically, and interactions
              of these types require a distinct clinical management strategy.
              This review focuses on mechanism-based inhibition, which occurs
              when a substrate forms a reactive intermediate, creating a stable
              enzyme-intermediate complex that irreversibly reduces enzyme
              activity. This type of inhibition can cause interactions with
              drugs such as omeprazole, paroxetine, macrolide antibiotics, or
              mirabegron. A good understanding of mechanism-based inhibition
              and proper clinical management is needed by clinicians when such
              drugs are prescribed. It is important to recognize
              mechanism-based inhibition since it cannot be prevented by
              separating the time of administration of the interacting drugs.
              Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the different types
              of mechanism-based inhibition, along with illustrative examples
              of how mechanism-based inhibition might affect prescribing and
              clinical behaviors.",
